TRIAL NAME: Phase I/II - NIH
Label: No
Predicted label : No
Reasoning:
The primary objective of the trial is to determine if the AdCh3NSmut1 and MVA-NSmut HCV vaccines can reduce the incidence of chronic HCV infection 
compared to placebo among HCV-uninfected injection drug users. Due to the high-risk population targeted by the trial and the potential challenges 
in recruiting and retaining participants who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as the additional challenges posed by potential 
non-adherence to study requirements, it is unlikely that this trial will progress to the next phase.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TRIAL NAME: Phase Ib - w/Daratumumab

Label: No
Predicted label : No
Reasoning:
The primary outcome measure of the trial is the number of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Since the progression of a clinical trial to the next 
phase heavily depends on the safety and tolerability of the investigational drug, if there are a significant number of DLTs observed in the study, 
it is less likely to progress to the next phase.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TRIAL NAME: Phase II - SPARC

Label: No
Predicted label : No
Reasoning:
The trial is designed as a phase II study to investigate the effect of cabozantinib in high-risk prostate cancer patients undergoing radical 
prostatectomy. The primary endpoint is to compare the apoptotic indices between patients who receive cabozantinib followed by prostatectomy 
and those undergoing immediate prostatectomy. The secondary objective involves immune phenotypic profiling in the peripheral blood and tumor 
microenvironment.

One factor that stands out in this trial is the small sample size of only 30 subjects. With such a limited number of participants, it may be 
challenging to draw statistically significant conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of cabozantinib in this setting. Additionally, 
the trial design involving a Safety Lead-In Cohort at only one site before expanding to the second site may cause delays in patient recruitment 
and overall trial progress.

Considering the complex eligibility criteria, including the exclusion of patients with prior treatment for prostate cancer, certain cardiovascular 
disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and uncontrolled hypertension, it may be difficult to find eligible participants. These stringent criteria 
could potentially hinder patient accrual and slow down trial progression.

Based on these factors, along with the limited sample size and potential challenges in patient recruitment, it is unlikely that this trial will 
progress to the next phase at this stage.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TRIAL NAME: Phase III - Fixed-Dose (7-17 yrs)

Label: Yes
Predicted label : Yes
Reasoning:
I predict that this clinical trial will progress to the next phase based on several key factors:

1. **Study Design**: The trial is a Phase III study, which indicates that the drug (once-weekly aripiprazole) has already passed safety and efficacy 
evaluations in earlier phases and is now being tested in a larger population to confirm its benefits and monitor any adverse effects.

2. **Drug Class**: Aripiprazole belongs to an established drug class with known mechanisms of action targeting Alpha Adrenergic Receptors, Dopamine 
receptors, and Serotonin receptors. These targets have been studied extensively in various psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Tourette's 
Syndrome, which increases the likelihood of success for this trial.

3. **Lead Sponsor**: The trial is sponsored by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development & Commercialization, Inc., a reputable company with experience in 
developing psychiatric medications. Industry experience and resources play a significant role in successfully conducting and progressing clinical trials.

4. **Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria**: The trial has well-defined criteria for participant selection, including confirmation of Tourette's Disorder 
diagnosis, specific age range (7-17 years), and restrictions on concomitant medications. These criteria help ensure a homogenous study population and 
reduce confounding factors that could affect trial outcomes.

5. **Efficacy Endpoints**: The primary outcome measure, the mean change from baseline to week 8 in Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) Total Tic 
Score, is a clinically relevant measure for evaluating the drug's effectiveness in reducing tic symptoms. The secondary outcome measure, the Clinical 
Global Impressions Scale for Tourette's Syndrome (CGI-TS) Score, adds further insight into the drug's overall impact on the participants.

Based on these factors, the trial appears to be well-designed, with a clear focus on evaluating the efficacy and safety of once-weekly aripiprazole 
in children and adolescents with Tourette's Disorder. Considering the established drug class, reputable sponsor, rigorous study criteria, and relevant 
efficacy endpoints, I predict that this trial is likely to progress to the next phase.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TRIAL NAME: Phase I - Relapsed/Refractory Lymphoma

Label: No
Predicted label : No
Reasoning:
I predict that this clinical trial will not progress to the next phase based on several factors.

Firstly, the study design seems to be in the early stages, specifically in Phase I evaluating the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose 
of the investigational drug OT-82 in relapsed or refractory lymphoma patients. Progression to the next phase usually depends on the successful completion 
of the primary outcomes of the current phase, which in this case is the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) during the dose escalation period. 
If a high rate of DLTs is observed, this can halt the progression of the trial to Phase II.

Secondly, the specific eligibility criteria listed in the Exclusion Criteria section are quite restrictive, with many conditions and circumstances that 
could disqualify potential participants. This could potentially limit the recruitment of a sufficient number of eligible participants needed to progress 
to the next phase. For example, patients with a history of certain medical conditions, ongoing treatments, or specific cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases 
are excluded from the trial.

Lastly, the primary outcome of assessing DLTs is critical for determining the safety profile of the investigational drug. If a significant number of participants 
experience DLTs, it could raise concerns about the safety and tolerability of OT-82 in this patient population. Adverse events or toxicity issues could lead to 
the discontinuation of the trial or a decision not to proceed to the Phase II portion evaluating preliminary efficacy.

Taken together, these factors lead me to predict that this clinical trial will not progress to the next phase based on the challenges and risks outlined in the 
study design and eligibility criteria.

TRIAL NAME: Phase III - REGAiN-1A

Label: No
Predicted label : No
Reasoning:
The study REGAiN-1A, which evaluates the efficacy and safety of Engensis on painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), has an extensive list of 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Some of the key factors that led to the conclusion of "No" for whether this trial will progress to the next phase include:

1. Complexity of the Inclusion Criteria: The study requires participants to meet various stringent criteria related to their medical history, diabetes 
management, pain levels, and comorbid conditions. This complexity may result in challenges in finding eligible participants, which can impact the feasibility 
of the trial.

2. Exclusion Criteria Related to Coexisting Conditions: The exclusion criteria exclude participants with various conditions such as progressive or 
degenerative neurological disorders, systemic diseases, renal dysfunction, and ophthalmologic conditions. These exclusions may limit the pool of eligible 
participants, potentially affecting recruitment and the overall progress of the trial. 

3. Exclusion of Participants on Certain Medications: The exclusion of participants currently taking gabapentin and pregabalin, which are commonly used 
for neuropathic pain, may further limit the recruitment pool and affect the generalizability of the study results to the broader population of individuals with painful DPN.

4. Complex Exclusion Criteria for Other Conditions: The study excludes participants with a history of cancer, certain infectious diseases, autoimmune 
conditions, and other medical issues. These exclusions could make it challenging to enroll a sufficient number of participants and may impact the overall progress of the trial.

5. Additional Restrictions on Concomitant Medications: The study restricts the use of certain medications during the trial, which may impact participant 
compliance and retention in the study, as well as potentially affecting the trial outcomes.

Given the stringent criteria and restrictions outlined in the study protocol, it is likely that the complexity and strict parameters of eligibility could 
present significant challenges in recruiting and retaining an adequate number of participants. These factors contribute to the prediction that this trial may face obstacles in progressing to the next phase.

PRIMARY OUTCOME: Safety and tolerability of escalating doses of CYT997 when given in combination with standard carboplatin therapy (Phase Ib component); SECONDARY OUTCOME: Objective response rate (ORR)
Label: No
Why stopped?:  Strategic
Predicted label : No. This trial will not transition to the next phase. The reason is that the lead sponsor, Gilead Sciences, has not shown any involvement in oncology-related clinical trials involving CYT997 or glioblastoma multiforme.

Label: No
Why stopped?:  VTL-308 failed to meet its primary endpoint, all follow up studies were terminated
Predicted label : No. This clinical trial did not transition to the next phase. The reason is that the sponsor, Vital Therapies, Inc., discontinued the ELAD program, including the VTL-308 trial, due to lack of efficacy in previous studies.
