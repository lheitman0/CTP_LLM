The main aim of the study is to check if there is a difference in how participants walk after treatment with TAK-071. Another aim is to see if it improves how participants think and remember. At the first visit, the study doctor will check who can take part. Participants who can take part will be picked for 1 of 2 groups by chance. Both groups will have 2 treatments but in a different order. The treatments are TAK-071 tablets or placebo. In this study, a placebo will look like the TAK-071 but will not have any medicine in it. One group will take TAK-071 for 6 weeks, have at least a 3-week break, then take a placebo for 6 weeks. The other group will take a placebo for 6 weeks, have at least a 3-week break, then take TAK-071 for 6 weeks. The participants will not know the order of their 2 treatments, nor will their study doctors. This is to help make sure the results are more reliable. The participants will visit the clinic at the beginning and end of each treatment for a check-up. 14 days after the 2nd treatment, clinic staff will telephone the participants for a final check-up. ; DRUG USED: TAK-071; INDICATION: Parkinson's Disease (PD); TARGET: Muscarinic M1 receptor; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Takeda; CRITERIA: Key Inclusion Criteria: 1.

Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Ramucirumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as docetaxel, gemcitabine hydrochloride, paclitaxel, and nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving cabozantinib alone or in combination with nivolumab may be more effective than standard chemotherapy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer. ; DRUG USED: Cabometyx / Cometriq; INDICATION: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC); TARGET: Angiopoietin Receptors (TIE-1 and TIE-2), FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT-3) , Hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met, HGFR), KIT/c-KIT, RET, VEGF Receptor (VEGFR); THERAPY: Monotherapy and Combo Therapy; LEAD SPONSOR: National Cancer Institute (NCI); CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - RANDOMIZATION (STEP 1): Patient must be >= 18 years of age - RANDOMIZATION (STEP 1): Patient must have pathologically confirmed non-squamous non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).

A randomized, open label design will be used in which one dose of IXT-m200 will be compared to treatment-as-usual (TAU). Approximately 40 participants will be enrolled in 4 cohorts. A dose escalation approach will be used so that progressively higher IXT-m200 doses will be evaluated in each cohort. In conjunction with safety monitoring, this design assures the opportunity to observe early safety findings before any participants are exposed to the next higher dose. The randomization ratio for IXT-m200 versus TAU is defined as 4:1 for each cohort so that the number of participants receiving TAU equals the number receiving each dose of IXT-m200 at the end of the study. Agitation scales and vital signs will be recorded to track effect of the antibody treatment versus TAU over time on agitation associated with METH use. While in the emergency department (ED), detailed and pertinent medical and psychiatric histories, and physical exam will be obtained, along with laboratory assessments and ECGs. In the ED, participants will give blood samples for analysis of METH and IXT-m200 concentrations and followed for development of adverse events. Participants will be evaluated at 2 days and 4 weeks after discharge from the ED for adverse events and drug use history.

Return the answer as the corresponding label: Yes or No.", "input": "TRIAL NAME: Phase I/II - SPRINT (Pediatric) (NCI); BRIEF: Background: - Plexiform neurofibromas are tumors that grow in and around nerves. The only way to treat them is with surgery. Some of these tumors cannot be completely removed. The tumors may be too large, too numerous, or in a bad location for surgery. An experimental drug called AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate may be able to prevent the tumors from growing, slow down their growth, or shrink them. This drug has been tested in adults with cancer and in children with some types of brain cancer. This study will test how well this drug works with these types of tumors. Objectives: - To study the safety and effectiveness of AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate in children and young adults with plexiform neurofibromas that cannot be completely removed by surgery. Eligibility: - Children and young adults between 12 and 18 years of age who have plexiform neurofibromas that cannot be completely removed by surgery. Design: - Patients will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, and imaging studies. - They will take the study drug twice a day with 8 ounces of water, every day for 28-day cycles of treatment. During study visits, participants will have blood and urine tests and physical exams. They will also have imaging studies to examine the tumor sizes and locations. They will answer questions about their health. They may have other tests as needed. - Participants will continue to receive the study drug as long as they have no severe side effects and the disease is not getting worse. ; DRUG USED: Koselugo; INDICATION: Neurofibromatosis (NF); TARGET: Mitogen-activated ERK kinase (MEK, MAPKK, MAP2K); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: National Cancer Institute (NCI); CRITERIA: -INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Age Phase I: greater than 3 years and less than or equal to 18 years at the time of study enrollment, if able to swallow whole capsules. The age limits including young children were chosen because early childhood and puberty are considered to be the greatest risk for disease progression, and selumetinib may provide the most benefit to this young group of patients. In addition, an important objective of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics of selumetinib in the pediatric population since it has been well studied in adults. Age Phase II: geater than 2 years of age and less than or equal to 18 years of age. BSA greater than or equal to 0.55 m(2), and able to swallow whole capsules. 2. Diagnosis: Patients with NF1 and inoperable PN, defined as PN that cannot be surgically completely removed without risk for substantial morbidity due to encasement of, or close proximity to, vital structures, invasiveness, or high vascularity of the PN. The PN has to cause (stratum 1) or have the potential to cause (stratum 2) significant morbidity, such as (but not limited to) head and neck lesions that could compromise the airway or great vessels, paraspinal lesions that can cause myelopathy brachial or lumbar plexus lesions that could cause nerve compression and loss of function, lesions that could result in major deformity (e.g., orbital lesions) or are significantly disfiguring, lesions of the extremity that cause limb hypertrophy or loss of function, and painful lesions. Patients will be enrolled into stratum 1 or 2 based on PN related morbidity. Histiologic confirmation of tumor is not necessary in the presence of consistent clinical and radiographic findings, but should be considered if malignant degeneration of a PN is clinically suspected. A PN is defined as a neurofibroma that has grown along the length of a nerve and may involve multiple fascicles and branches. A spinal PN involves two or more levels with connection between the levels or extending laterally along the nerve. In addition to PN, all study subjects must have either positive genetic testing for NF1 or have at least one other diagnostic criterion for NF1 listed below: (NIH Consensus conference): - Six or more caf(SqrRoot)(Copyright)-au-lait macules (greater than or equal to 0.5cm in prepubertal subjects or greater than or equal to 1.5 cm in post pubertal subjects) - Freckling in axilla or groin - Optic glioma - Two or more Lisch nodules - A distinctive bony lesion (dysplasia of the sphenoid bone or dysplasia or thinning of long bone cortex) - A first-degree relative with NF1 3. Measurable disease: Patients must have at least one measurable PN, defined as a lesion of at least 3 cm measured in one dimension. Patients who underwent surgery for resection of a PN are eligible provided the PN was incompletely resected and is measurable. Phase II: Measurability and suitability for volumetric MRI analysis of the target PN must be confirmed with the NCI POB prior to enrolling a patient. The target PN will be defined as the clinically most relevant PN, which has to be amenable to volumetric MRI analysis. PN will be classified as typical PN versus nodular PN versus solitary nodular PN prior to enrollment 4. Prior Therapy: Patients with NF1 will only be eligible if complete tumor resection is not considered to be feasible without substantial risk or morbidity. - Since there is no standard effective chemotherapy for patients with NF1 and PN, patients may be treated on this trial without having received prior medical therapy directed at their PN. - Since selumetinib is not expected to cause substantial myelosuppression, there will be no limit to number of prior myelosuppressive regimen for PN or other tumor manifestations associated with NF1 such as optic glioma. - Patients who have received previous investigational agents or biologic therapy, such as tipifarnib, pirfenidone, Peg-Intron, sorafenib, imatinib or other targeted therapies are eligible for enrollment. At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since receiving medical therapy directed at the PN. Patients who received prior medical therapy for their PN must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior therapy to less than or equal to grade 1 before entering this study. - Growth factors that support platelet or white cell number or function must not have been administered within 7 days prior to enrollment. - At least 6 weeks must have elapsed prior to enrollment since the patient received any prior radiation therapy. - At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since any surgeries, with evidence of good wound healing. 5. Performance status: Patients greater than or equal to 16 years of age must have a Karnofsky performance level of greater than or equal to70%, and children < 16 years old must have a Lansky performance of greater than or equal to 70%. Patients who are wheelchair bound because of paralysis secondary to a plexiform neurofibroma should be considered ambulatory when they are up in their wheelchair. Similarly, patients with limited mobility secondary to need for mechanical support (such as an airway PN requiring tracheostomy or CPAP) will also be considered ambulatory for the purpose of the study. 6. Hematologic Function: Patients must have an absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1500/(micro)l, hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9g/dl, and platelet greater than or equal to 100,000/(micro)l. 7. Hepatic Function: Patients must have bilirubin within 1.5 times the upper limit of normal for age, with the exception of Gilbert syndrome, and AST/ ALT within less than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal. 8. Renal Function: Patients must have a creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR greater than or equal to 60ml/min/1.73 m(2) or a normal serum creatinine based on age described below. Age (years)/Maximum Serum Creatinine(mg/dL): Age less than or equal to 5/Maximum Serum Creatinine 0.8 mg/dL Age greater than 5 to less than or equal to 10/ Maximum Serum Creatinine 1.0 mg/dL Age greater than 10 to less than or equal to 15/ Maximum Serum Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL Age greater than 15/ Maximum Serum Creatinine 1.5 mg/dL 9. Cardiac Function: Normal ejection fraction (ECHO or cardiac MRI) greater than or equal to 53% (or the institutional normal; if a range is given then the upper value of the range will be used); QTcF less than or equal to 450 msec. 10. Adequate Blood Pressure defined as: A blood pressure (BP) less than or equal to the 95th percentile for age, height, and gender measured as described in (Appendix IB). Adequate blood pressure can be achieved using medication for treatment of hypertension. 11. Informed Consent: Diagnostic or laboratory studies performed exclusively to determine eligibility for this trial must only be done after obtaining written informed consent from all patients or their legal guardians (if the patient is <18 years old). When appropriate, pediatric patients will be included in all discussions. This can be accomplished through one of the following mechanisms: a) the NCI POB screening protocol, b) an IRB-approved institutional screening protocol, or c) the study-specific protocol. Documentation of the informed consent for screening will be maintained in the patient s research chart. Studies or procedures that were performed for clinical indications (not exclusively to determine eligibility) may be used for baseline values even if the studies were done before informed consent was obtained. 12. Willingness to avoid excessive sun exposure and use adequate sunscreen protection if sun exposure is anticipated. 13. Willingness to avoid the ingestion of grapefruit and Seville oranges (as well as other products containing these fruits, e.g. grapefruit juice or marmalade) during the study, as these may affect selumetinib metabolism.

Provision of signed and dated, written ICFs must occur prior to any mandatory study-specific procedures, sampling, and analyses. In addition to ICF1 and ICF2, patients will provide signed and dated written optional genetic informed consent prior to collection of a sample for optional genetic analysis at the time of second screening (Table 2). This is different from the genetic samples and testing covered by ICF1, which are mandatory for participation in this study. Criteria and procedures initiated with the signing of ICF1 1. ICF1 must be signed and dated prior to any study procedures and prior to the planned surgical resection of the primary NSCLC, with the exceptions noted below. This consent will cover the study-specific first screening procedures outlined in Table 1. Exception: Patients will be permitted to sign ICF1 up to Week 3 (Day 21) postsurgery. Patients identified after Week 3 post-surgery but prior to Week 5 (Day 35) post-surgery may be allowed to sign ICF1 depending on the outcome of the discussion with the study physician. In these cases, a whole blood sample and resected tumor tissue must be collected and sent to the diagnostic lab as soon as possible after ICF1 is signed for development of the personalized panel. A plasma sample must still be collected at Week 3-5 (Day 21-35) post-surgery, even if creation of the personalized panel for MRD detection is delayed. Age 2. Age \u226518 years at the time of screening. Sex 3. Male and/or female. Type of patient and disease characteristics 4. Individuals who have diagnosis of histologically confirmed NSCLC (WHO 2015 classification) with resectable (stage II-III) disease (according to IASLC Staging Manual in Thoracic Oncology v8.0). Select (ie, T3N2 or T4N2) stage IIIB patients will be eligible, provided that they are upstaged to T3N2 or T4N2 based on confirmed pathology. Patients who are staged asT3N2 or T4N2 prior to surgery are not eligible. 5. A contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scan of the chest must have been done for surgical planning prior to surgery. It is recommended that patients undergo combined FDG-PET (18F-Fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography) and CT scan (contrastenhanced or low-dose CT component) in order to rule out detectable extrathoracic, extracranial metastasis and to assess for potential mediastinal lymph node involvement prior to surgery. In the absence of pre-operative FDG-PET CT imaging, pre-operative contrast-enhanced CT imaging or MRI scan must cover liver and adrenal glands. If only CT is available, or FDG-PET reveals suspicious lymph node mediastinal involvement, it is recommended that invasive pre-operative mediastinal staging is performed according to the algorithm of the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons guidelines (algorithm to follow for primary mediastinal staging if only pre-operative CT is available [De Leyn et al 2007], algorithm to follow for primary mediastinal staging when PET-CT is available [De Leyn et al 2014]). It is preferred that imaging occurs within 6 weeks prior to surgery. Brain MRI (preferred) or brain CT with IV contrast is required for complete staging of the tumor. 6. Complete resection of the primary NSCLC is mandatory. The primary tumor must be deemed resectable by a multidisciplinary evaluation that must include a thoracic surgeon certified or trained according to local standards and who performs lung cancer surgery as a significant part of their practice. Surgical resection of the primary NSCLC can occur by open thoracotomy or by video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and resection can be achieved by segmentectomy, lobectomy, sleeve resection, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy. Patients undergoing wedge resection are not eligible for this study. Note: Patients undergoing segmentectomy must have tumors less than 2 cm in maximum diameter. Where a resection has been extended by means of a wedge resection of an adjacent lobe to ensure complete resection of a tumor at or crossing a fissure between lobes, this is acceptable if surgical margins are clear of disease. Where the resection of a second tumor nodule (eg, a T4 lesion) is undertaken by means of a wedge resection of a separate lobe, then the patient is not eligible. At a minimum, the following parameters should be met for a tumor to be declared completely resected: 1. The surgeon performing the resection should remove all gross disease by the end of surgery. All surgical margins of resection must be macroscopically negative for tumor. 2. Pathology and/or operative reports must include the examination of at least 2 different mediastinal lymph node (N2) levels, one of which is the subcarinal node-group (level 7) and the second of which is lobe-specific (defined below). Note: In the uncommon clinical situation where the surgeon thoroughly examines a mediastinal lymph node level and does not find any lymph nodes, that mediastinal lymph node level may be counted among the minimum 2 required levels. However, the surgeon must clearly document in the operative report or in a separate written statement that the lymph node level was explored and no lymph nodes were present. Normal appearing lymph nodes, if present, must be biopsied or removed. Exploration of nodes must clearly be documented in medical file if not recorded in operative report. Note: Lobe-specific lymph node stations are classified based on the location of the primary tumor as follows (based on IASLC 2009 lymph node map terminology [Rusch et al 2009]): Stations 2R and 4R for right upper lobe or middle lobe tumors, stations 4L, 5, and 6 for left upper lobe tumors, stations 8 and 9 for lower lobe tumors of both sides (Adachi et al 2017, Rami-Porta et al 2005). 3. No extracapsular nodal extension of the tumor is observed in resected mediastinal N2 lymph nodes. Note: Extracapsular nodal extension in resected N1 nodes is permitted. Note: The highest mediastinal node resected can be positive for malignancy. Note: Carcinoma-in-situ can be present at the bronchial margin. 7. All patients who enrol in the study prior to surgery must have a pre-surgical plasma sample collected for MRD evaluation. Patients will not be excluded from randomization based on the results of analysing the pre-surgical plasma samples. The following criteria must be met prior to signing ICF2: 8. Confirmation of suitable samples of resected tumor tissue and whole blood for WES of tumor and germline DNA, respectively, and creation of Sponsor-approved personalized panel for MRD detection. Tumor tissue and whole blood samples must be provided to the diagnostic laboratory for development of the personalized panel as soon as possible. Germline sequencing of whole blood is mandatory. Note: If a patient's tumor has less than the requisite 50 tumor-specific variants, a panel cannot be built and the patient will no longer be able to participate in the study. 9. Established MRD status (MRD+ or MRD-) based on Sponsor-approved personalized assay of a plasma sample collected at Week 3-5 (Day 21-35) post-surgery. 10. Known tumor PD-L1 status determined at a central reference laboratory testing service using a validated Ventana SP263 PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay prior randomization. Patients with unknown PD-L1 status are not eligible for the study. Criteria and procedures initiated with the signing of ICF2 11. Post-operative CT scan of the chest (including liver and adrenal glands) performed within 28 days + 7 days prior to randomization. If clinically indicated, additional scans (such as brain MRI [preferred] or brain CT with IV contrast) should be performed to confirm no evidence of metastasis. 12. ICF2 must be signed and dated after MRD status is determined and prior to initiation of any study-specific procedures, sampling, and analyses outlined in SoAs in Table 2 and Table 3. Randomization must occur within the 12 weeks (+ 7 days) following surgery. 13. WHO/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. 14. Complete postoperative wound healing must have occurred prior to randomization; patients must have recovered from all acute, reversible toxic effects from prior treatments (excluding alopecia) that could potentially adversely impact further administration of durvalumab/placebo or chemotherapy according to the Investigator's judgment. 15. Eligible to tolerate 4 cycles of platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy 16. Adequate organ and marrow function as described in the protocol. 17 Must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks Weight 18 Body weight >30 kg Exclusion criteria: Diagnostic assessments 1. Post-operative imaging demonstrating unequivocal evidence of disease recurrence or tissue biopsy-proven disease recurrence. In the event of lymphadenopathy on imaging that would lead to exclusion, histopathological confirmation of lymph node metastasis should be obtained prior to excluding a patient from the study. If pathological confirmation of lymph-node metastasis is not technically feasible and imaging appearance are deemed unequivocal for relapse, the patient will be excluded. 2. EGFR-mutant and/or ALK-translocation-positive, as assessed either from a pre-surgical biopsy sample (preferred) or the resected tumor tissue (if biopsy was not evaluable or available). Any of the following scenarios are acceptable for this study: Where EGFR/ALK results are obtained from a pre-surgical tissue biopsy as part of standard local practice, the patient must be confirmed EGFR/ALK wild-type prior to enrolling in the study. Results obtained from testing the patient's primary tumor tissue during screening for another AstraZeneca study may be used in this study. Results from local testing of a pre-surgical biopsy. All local EGFR/ALK testing performed locally must be performed using a well-validated, local regulatory-approved test. EGFR/ALK may be tested centrally if local testing is unavailable. Patients will still be allowed to continue with first screening procedures while testing is ongoing but will not be able to continue into second screening if their tumor tests positive for EGFR mutations and/or ALK translocations. 3. Mixed small cell and NSCLC histology. 4. Require re-resection or are deemed to have unresectable NSCLC by a multidisciplinary evaluation that must include a thoracic surgeon who performs lung cancer surgery as a significant part of their practice. 5. Patients who are candidates to undergo only wedge resections. Medical conditions 6. History of allogeneic organ or bone marrow transplantation. 7. Non-leukocyte-depleted whole blood transfusion within 120 days of genetic sample collection.

Return the answer as the corresponding label: Yes or No.", "input": "TRIAL NAME: Phase II - ATP; BRIEF: Depression is one of the most important causes of disability in the world today, with major personal, social and economic costs. Although some moderately effective drug treatments are already available, about a third of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) remain depressed despite current treatment. There is growing evidence that inflammation - the response of the body's immune system to physical and social stresses - can cause depressive symptoms in some patients. It is therefore predicted that anti-inflammatory drugs could have anti-depressant effects and the research team aims to test this using a new drug, JNJ-54175446, which blocks the activity of a receptor called P2X7. P2X7 is present on many immune cells and plays a key role in the release of inflammatory molecules during stress, which may be linked to stress-related depression. The research team will recruit approximately up to 142 participants with MDD to this clinical trial. Patients will have moderate-severe depressive symptoms despite ongoing treatment with a conventional anti-depressant drug, and they will have blood test results at screening that indicate they are likely to have active P2X7 signalling in the brain. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to receive either 50mg/day JNJ-54175446 or placebo for 8 weeks.

Return the answer as the corresponding label: Yes or No.", "input": "TRIAL NAME: Phase Ib/II - Atrophy Secondary to AMD; BRIEF: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease which causes people to lose their sharp central vision over time. Aging damages the macula, which is in the middle of the retina - the light-sensitive part at the back of the eye. There are 2 types of AMD - wet AMD and dry AMD. The advanced stage of dry AMD causes vision loss. This is known as geographic atrophy. AMD makes everyday tasks like reading or driving difficult. ASP7317 is a potential new treatment for people with AMD. ASP7317 are human stem cells which have changed into cells found in the retina. ASP7317 is injected under the macula. It is hoped that ASP7317 will replace some of the damaged cells in the macula and improve vision for people with dry AMD. Before ASP7317 is available as a treatment, the researchers need to check its safety and how well it is tolerated. They will also check for signs of improved vision. People taking part in this study will be older people who have geographic atrophy caused by dry AMD. This is an open-label study. This means that people in this study and clinic staff will know that people will receive ASP7317. There will be 3 doses of ASP7317. These are low, medium and high numbers of cells. ASP7317 will be injected under the macula after the person is given either a local or a general anesthetic. To prevent the body from rejecting the cells, people will take tablets of tacrolimus a few days before receiving ASP7317 for up to a few weeks afterwards. Other medicines will be taken during this time to stop infections. There will be 2 groups in the study. Group 1 will be people with severe vision loss and Group 2 will be people with moderate vision loss. There will be different small groups of people within Group 1 and Group 2, with each small group receiving 1 of the 3 doses of ASP7317. Different small groups of people within Group 1 and Group 2 will receive lower to higher doses of ASP7317. Each small group will only receive 1 dose. Group 1 will start treatment first. At each dose, a medical expert panel will check the results of the first person in the group to decide if the rest of the group will receive the same dose. Then, the panel will decide if more people may receive the same dose or if the next group may receive the next highest dose. The panel will use the results from the lower dose of Group 1 to decide when Group 2 starts treatment (also at the lower dose). The panel will also use the results of the middle and higher doses in Group 1 to decide when and how many people in Group 2 can receive these doses. During the study, people will visit the clinic several times for up to 12 months (1 year). During all visits, the study doctors will check for any medical problems after receiving ASP7317. Vital signs will be checked a few days before treatment with ASP7317 and up to about a month afterwards. Vital signs include blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. At some visits, the study doctors will also take blood samples for blood tests. At most visits, people will have eye tests and have different images, scans, and measurements taken. This could be for the affected eye or both eyes, depending on the test. People can visit the clinic extra times, if needed. ; DRUG USED: ASP7317; INDICATION: Dry Age-Related Macular Degeneration (Dry AMD)/Geographic Atrophy (Ophthalmology); TARGET: Stem Cells/Other Cell Therapies; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Astellas Institute for Regenerative Medicine; CRITERIA: General Inclusion Criteria - Participant must be willing to take tacrolimus and willing to discontinue any medications that have a known strong interaction with tacrolimus. - Participant is able and willing to undertake all scheduled visits and assessments up to the week 52 visit. - Participant who is taking an antidepressant must be on a stable and effective dosage and must be willing to take it reliably for as long as it is required. - Participant must be willing and medically suitable to undergo monitored anesthesia care during the vitrectomy and subretinal injection. - Participant agrees to conform to local and institutional policies regarding active COVID-19 infections. - Participant agrees not to participate in another interventional study until the 52-week visit has been completed. - Female participant is not pregnant and at least 1 of the following conditions apply: - Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) - WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance from the time of informed consent through at least 52 weeks after investigational product (IP) administration. - Female participant must agree not to breastfeed starting at screening and throughout the study period and for 52 weeks after IP administration. - Female participant must not donate ova starting at first dose of IP and throughout the study period and for 52 weeks after IP administration. - Male participant with female partner(s) of childbearing potential (including breastfeeding partner) must agree to use contraception throughout the treatment period and for 52 weeks after IP administration. - Male participant must not donate sperm during the treatment period and for 52 weeks after IP administration. - Male participant with pregnant partner(s) must agree to remain abstinent or use a condom for the duration of the pregnancy throughout the study period and for 52 weeks after IP administration.

Return the answer as the corresponding label: Yes or No.", "input": "TRIAL NAME: Phase II - Singapore General Hospital; BRIEF: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a pandemic. COVID-19 poses a mortality risk of 3-7%, rising to 20% in older patients with co-morbidities. Of all infected patients, 15-20% will develop severe respiratory symptoms necessitating hospital admission. Around 5% of patients will require invasive mechanical ventilation, and up to 50% will die. Evidence in severe COVID-19 suggests that these patients experience cytokine storm and progressed rapidly with acute respiratory distress syndrome and eventual multi-organ failure. Early identification and immediate treatment of hyperinflammation is thus recommended to reduce mortality. Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) has been shown to be a myelopoietic growth factor that has pleiotropic effects in promoting the differentiation of immature precursors into polymorphonuclear neutrophils, monocytes/ macrophages and dendritic cells, and also in controlling the function of fully mature myeloid cells. It plays an important role in priming monocytes for production of proinflammatory cytokines under TLR and NLR stimulation. It has a broad impact on the processes driving DC differentiation and affects DC effector function at the mature state. Importantly, GM-CSF plays a critical role in host defense and stimulating antiviral immunity. Detailed studies have also shown that GM-CSF is necessary for the maturation of alveolar macrophages from foetal monocytes and the maintenance of these cells in adulthood. The known toxicology, pharmacologic and safety data also support the use of Leukine\u00ae in hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS due to COVID-19. This study aims to recruit patients with evidence of pneumonia and hypoxia who have increased risk for severe disease and need for mechanical ventilation. The overall hypothesis is that GM-CSF has antiviral immunity, can provide the stimulus to restore immune homeostasis in the lung with acute lung injury from COVID-19, and can promote lung repair mechanisms, which would lead to improvement in lung oxygenation parameters. ; DRUG USED: Leukine; INDICATION: COVID-19 Treatment; TARGET: Granulocyte Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor Receptor (GM-CSFR)/CD116; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Singapore General Hospital; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection - Presence of acute hypoxic respiratory failure defined as (either or both) - Saturation < 94% on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen - PaO2/FiO2 below 350 - Age 21-80 - Able and willing to provide informed consent Exclusion Criteria: - Patients who are already on supplemental oxygen of FiO2 \u2265 0.4 - Patients with known history of serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, to human GM-CSF such as Leukine\u00ae, yeast-derived products, or any component of the product. - Mechanical ventilation before start of study - Patients enrolled in another investigational drug study - Pregnant or breastfeeding females (all female subjects of childbearing potential status must have negative pregnancy test at screening) - Patients with peripheral white blood cell count above 25,000 per microliter and/or active myeloid malignancy - Patients on high dose systemic steroids (> 20mg methylprednisolone or equivalent) - Patients on lithium carbonate therapy - Patients with serum ferritin >2000 mcg/ml (which will exclude ongoing HLH) ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: Measuring oxygenation; SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: ", "output": "Yes"}, {"instruction": "Predict if this trial will transition to the next phase.

OS2966 is a therapeutic antibody blocking a cell surface receptor governing fundamental biological processes that allow cancer cells to grow, spread and become resistant to cancer treatment. Despite availability of new promising cancer treatments, successful treatment of HGG has been limited by the presence of the brain's protective blood brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is made up of tightly knit cells that block entry of several substances including cancer treatments. To overcome this obstacle, a technique called convection-enhanced-delivery (CED) will be utilized to deliver OS2966 directly to the site of disease. Convection-enhanced delivery involves placement of one or more catheters into the brain tumor and tumor-infiltrated brain in order to slowly pump a therapy into the tissue.

It has been approved to treat renal cell cancer and soft tissue sarcomas in patients who have received prior chemotherapy. ARQ 197 (Tivantinib) is an experimental drug that blocks a protein called mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET), which cancer cells need to grow. Studies suggest that some drugs that block blood vessel growth can increase the production of c-MET in tumors, which helps cancer cells keep growing. Blocking both blood vessel growth and c-MET with pazopanib and ARQ 197 may help kill cancer cells faster. This study will use these drugs to treat solid tumors that have not responded to earlier treatments. Objectives: - To test the safety and effectiveness of pazopanib and ARQ 197 for advanced solid tumors. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced solid tumors that have not responded to earlier treatments. Design: - Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also have blood and urine tests, and imaging studies. - The study drugs will be given in 4-week cycles of treatment. Participants will take pazopanib once a day and ARQ 197 twice a day by mouth. Some participants will start with pazopanib or ARQ 197 alone for the first week.

When prostate cancer is confined to the prostate there is a high chance of cure. However, it is outside the prostate or comes back after treatment, additional therapy may be needed. Current methods of imaging prostate cancer are limited. Researchers want to see if a radiotracer called 18F-DCFPyL can identify prostate cancer in patients who have a high risk of cancer spreading outside the prostate or who have signs of recurrent cancer after treatment. Objectives: To see if the radiotracer 18F-DCFyL can help identify prostate cancer in the body before or after therapy. Eligibility: Men ages 18 and older who have prostate cancer that has been newly diagnosed, or has relapsed after radiation or surgery Design: Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will have blood taken. Participants will be divided into 2 groups. - Group 1 will be men with cancer that has been newly diagnosed as high risk by their doctor who are scheduled to have prostate removal surgery or undergo biopsy before radiation therapy. - Group 2 will be men who have presumed prostate cancer relapse after prostate removal surgery or radiation therapy. Both groups will have scans taken. Participants will lie still on a table in a machine that takes pictures of their body. 18F-DCFyL will be injected by intravenous (IV) line. Participants will be contacted for follow-up after scans. Participants in Group 1 may have surgery to remove their prostate gland or a biopsy to remove some prostate tissue. This procedure will be standard of care and is not a part of this study. They will also have an extra MRI scan of their prostate. For this, a tube, called an endorectal coil, will be placed in their rectum. Other tubes may be wrapped around the inside of their pelvis. A contrast agent will be given by IV.

Return the answer as the corresponding label: Yes or No.", "input": "TRIAL NAME: Phase II - Pediatric Low Grade Gliomas; BRIEF: This study is for patients up to 21 years of age who have a tumor called a low grade glioma of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). The tumor has grown despite attempts to control it with chemotherapy or radiation. Low grade gliomas are a group of tumors that tend to grow slowly and could be cured if every bit of the tumor were surgically removed. These tumors are called Grade I or II astrocytomas. These tumors often grow in parts of the brain that prevent total removal without devastating neurologic complications or death. Although some low grade gliomas never grow, most will and are treated with either chemotherapy or radiation. There is good data showing that the growth of most low grade gliomas can be controlled with chemotherapy or radiation. However, some low grade gliomas in children and young adults grow despite these treatments. Poly-ICLC is a new drug that has been used safely in children and adults with different types of brain tumors. Earlier studies showed that this drug worked better for children and young adults with low grade gliomas than for children with more aggressive brain tumors. The main purpose of this study is to use Poly-ICLC treatment in a larger number of patients to see how well it works and how many side effects occur. As Poly-ICLC is not FDA approved, this study is authorized to use it under Investigational New Drug (IND)# 43984, held by Oncovir. Subjects will get injections of Poly-ICLC into muscle two times weekly. The first treatments will be given in the clinic so allergic or other severe reactions, if any, can be monitored. If subjects tolerate the injections and don't have a severe reaction, then the rest of the injections will be given at home. Subjects/caregivers will be trained to give injections. Treatment will last for about 2 years. Subjects may stay on treatment for longer than 2 years if their tumor shrinks in response to the injections, if study doctors think it is safe, if subjects want to remain on treatment, and if Poly-ICLC is available. Risks: Poly-ICLC has been used safely in children and adults at the dose used in this study, and at higher doses. Frequently seen side effects include irritation of the skin at the injection site and mild flu-like symptoms. These are usually relieved or avoided by use of over-the-counter medicines like acetaminophen (Tylenol). ; DRUG USED: Poly-ICLC; INDICATION: Brain Cancer (Malignant Glioma; AA and glioblastoma (GBM)); TARGET: Interferon Receptor, Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Wake Forest University Health Sciences; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Age:Patients must be between 0 - 21 years of age when registered on this protocol. - Diagnosis:Patients must have pathologically confirmed low grade glioma with histologic subtypes interpreted as World Health Organization (WHO) grade I and II including: - juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma (JPA) - pleomorphic JPA - diffuse astrocytoma (fibrillary, gemistocytic, giant cell, or pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma) - low grade oligoastrocytoma - low grade oligodendroglioma - low grade glioma not otherwise specified (NOS) Tumors of all regions of the CNS, with appropriate histology are eligible for study.

Radiographic progression is defined as >40% increase in the product of the three perpendicular diameters of initial tumor relative to the initial baseline measurement - length (L)x width (W) x transverse (T) (current scan) > 1.4 x L x W x T (initial scan), or the development of any new sites of disease independent of the response of the initial tumor. See section 7.1.2 for methodology for tumor measurement. 3. Post radiation changes are often seen on post-treatment imaging studies, so that classification of a patient as having progressive disease may require several serial MRI's if the child has received radiation within the preceding 12 months. 4. Tumor volume includes the entire tumor volume seen on gadolinium enhanced T1 MRI plus non-enhancing abnormality seen on T2 or FLAIR. 5. All tumor cysts will be included in the tumor volume 6.

While agitation may have various underlying causes, patients with schizophrenia are especially vulnerable to acute episodes of agitation, especially during exacerbation of disease, and clinicians do not always diagnose these episodes early enough. Agitation associated with psychosis is a frequent reason for emergency department visits, and unless it is recognized early and managed effectively, it can rapidly escalate to potentially dangerous behaviors, including physical violence. Educating psychiatric professionals about the timely and accurate diagnosis of agitation among patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and developing a well-tolerated easily administered medication will contribute to the prompt and effective management of this condition and could help reduce the risk of violent behavior and other undesirable outcomes.

Cancers caused by HPV have a HPV protein called E7 inside of their cells. In this new therapy, researchers take a person s blood, remove certain white blood cells, and insert genes that make them to target cancer cells that have the E7 protein. The genetically changed cells, called E7 TCR cells, are then given back to the person to fight the cancer. Researchers want to see if this can help people. Objective: To determine a safe dose and efficacy of E7 TCR cells and whether these cells can help patients. Eligibility: Adults ages 18 and older with an HPV-16-associated cancer, including cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, or oropharyngeal. Design: Participants will list all their medicines. Participants will have many screening tests, including imaging procedures, heart and lung tests, and lab tests. They will have a large catheter inserted into a vein. Participants will have leukapheresis. Blood will be removed through a needle in the arm. A machine separates the white blood cells. The rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other arm. The cells will be changed in the lab. Participants will stay in the hospital. Over several days, they will get: Chemotherapy drugs E7 TCR cells Shots or injections to stimulate the cells Participants will be monitored in the hospital up to 12 days. They will get support medicine and have blood and lab tests. Participants will have a clinic visit about 40 days after cell infusion.

This drug has been used in other research studies and laboratory experiments. It has also been studied in phase I trials, where the appropriate dosing has been determined. Ganetespib is considered an \"HSP90 inhibitor\". By blocking HSP90, ganetespib is thought to reduce the ability of cancer cells to become resistant to treatment. Fulvestrant is a hormonal therapy that works by attaching to estrogen receptors. In doing so, it can block the effect of estrogen on cancer cells. In addition, fulvestrant causes a decrease in the number of estrogen receptors. Fulvestrant is a drug that is approved by the FDA for treatment of metastatic, hormone receptor positive breast cancer, based upon the results of phase III clinical trials. In the laboratory, adding ganetespib to fulvestrant appears to improve its effectiveness. It is not known whether this is true in humans. In this research study, we are evaluating the effect of the addition of ganetespib to fulvestrant in participants with hormone receptor-positive, metastatic breast cancer. ; DRUG USED: ADX-1612; INDICATION: Breast Cancer; TARGET: Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90); THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer that is metastatic or unresectable locally advanced - Estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive breast cancer - HER2 negative - Measurable disease is required (effective 4/30/14: all non-measurable [evaluable] disease slots have been filled) - Endocrine resistant breast cancer - May have received up to one prior line of chemotherapy for metastatic or unresectable locally advanced breast cancer - May have initiated bisphosphonate therapy prior to start of protocol therapy - Must be at least 2 weeks from prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy - ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 - Availability of tissue block from initial breast cancer diagnosis and/or metastatic recurrence - For subjects with biopsy-accessible disease, must be willing to undergo a required on-treatment research biopsy - Adequate IV access Exclusion Criteria: - Pregnant or breastfeeding - Prior treatment with HSP90 inhibitor - Prior treatment with fulvestrant - Concurrent treatment with commercial agents or other agents with the intent to treat the participant's malignancy - Untreated or progressive brain metastases - Pending visceral crisis, in the opinion of the treating investigator - History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to fulvestrant or ganetespib - Uncontrolled intercurrent illness - Other malignancies within 3 years ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: Progression-Free Survival (PFS); SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: Grade 3-4 Toxicity Rate", "output": "No"}, {"instruction": "Predict if this trial will transition to the next phase.

Return the answer as the corresponding label: Yes or No.", "input": "TRIAL NAME: Phase I/II - CD30+ HL/NHL (UNC); BRIEF: The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from disease caused by bacteria or toxic substances. Antibodies work by binding those bacteria or substances, which stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that are infected. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most patients. This study is designed to combine both T cells and antibodies to create a more effective treatment called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted against the CD30 antigen (ATLCAR.CD30) administration. In previous studies, it has been shown that a new gene can be put into T cells that will increase their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. The new gene that is put in the T cells in this study makes an antibody called anti-CD30. This antibody sticks to lymphoma cells because of a substance on the outside of the cells called CD30. Anti-CD30 antibodies have been used to treat people with lymphoma, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients. For this study, the anti-CD30 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These CD30 chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells seem to kill some of the tumor, but they do not last very long in the body and so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown. The purpose of this research study is to establish a safe dose of ATLCAR.CD30 cells to infuse after lymphodepleting chemotherapy and to estimate the number patients whose cancer does not progress for two years after ATLCAR.CD30 administration. This study will also look at other effects of ATLCAR.CD30 cells, including their effect on the patient's cancer. ; DRUG USED: TT11 CD30 CAR-T; INDICATION: Hodgkin's Lymphoma; TARGET: Autologous Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells (CAR-T), Cluster of Differentiation 30 (CD30) / TNFRSF8, Immune System; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria Prior to Cell Procurement Informed consent explained to, understood by and signed by the subject or legal guardian for pediatric subjects; subject and/or legal guradian given a copy of informed consent form for procurement Ages 3 to 17 years of age for pediatric subjects (weight must be \u226510kg), and for adults ages \u226518 years of age Diagnosis of recurrent HL or NHL in subjects who have failed >2 prior treatment regimens.

Return the answer as the corresponding label: Yes or No.", "input": "TRIAL NAME: Phase II - Breast Cancer/Endometrial Carcinoma (NCI); BRIEF: Background: The new drug ONC201 have been shown to kill breast cancer and endometrial cancer cells in the laboratory. The exact mechanism of action is not completely clear yet, but the ONC201 destroys the mitochondria inside the cells. Blocking mitochondrial activity may kill tumor cells, which would shrink tumors. Researchers want to see if ONC201 helps shrink tumors of certain breast or endometrial cancers and if that effect is maintained. Objective: To see if ONC201 shrinks tumors with a lasting effect. Eligibility: Adults ages 18 and older who have metastatic breast cancer (hormone-positive or triple-negative) or metastatic endometrial cancers. Design: Participants will be screened with: - Medical history - Physical exam - Heart, blood, and urine tests - Computed tomography (CT) and bone scans - Review of medical report and tumor sample - Participants will have a tumor biopsy before starting treatment and after 5 weeks taking the study drug. A scan or ultrasound may be used to guide the biopsy. Patients will receive local anesthetic and a needle will remove a small piece of tumor. - The study will be done in 28-day cycles. Every day 1 of each cycle participants will repeat most screening tests, will be seen by the physician and receive a supply of the study drug. - Participants will take the study drug by mouth once every 7 days. They will keep a diary of when they take the drug and any side effects. During cycle 1, participants will get weekly calls to discuss their health and symptoms. Images will be repeated every 2 cycles to evaluate response to the treatment. ; DRUG USED: ONC201; INDICATION: Breast Cancer; TARGET: Dopamine 2 (D2) Receptor; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: National Cancer Institute (NCI); CRITERIA: - INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR COHORT 1: HORMONE RECEPTOR POSITIVE BREAST CANCER: - Patients must have histologically confirmed persistent or recurrent invasive metastatic hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) normal breast cancer for which standard curative measures do not exist or are no longer effective.
