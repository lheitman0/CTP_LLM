Although some moderately effective drug treatments are already available, about a third of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) remain depressed despite current treatment. There is growing evidence that inflammation - the response of the body's immune system to physical and social stresses - can cause depressive symptoms in some patients. It is therefore predicted that anti-inflammatory drugs could have anti-depressant effects and the research team aims to test this using a new drug, JNJ-54175446, which blocks the activity of a receptor called P2X7. P2X7 is present on many immune cells and plays a key role in the release of inflammatory molecules during stress, which may be linked to stress-related depression. The research team will recruit approximately up to 142 participants with MDD to this clinical trial. Patients will have moderate-severe depressive symptoms despite ongoing treatment with a conventional anti-depressant drug, and they will have blood test results at screening that indicate they are likely to have active P2X7 signalling in the brain. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to receive either 50mg/day JNJ-54175446 or placebo for 8 weeks. Participants will be assessed at weeks 2, 5 and 8 using a standard clinical depression scale and the scores compared between those treated with placebo and those treated with JNJ-54175446.

Return the answer as the corresponding label: Yes or No.", "input": "TRIAL NAME: Phase Ib/II - Atrophy Secondary to AMD; BRIEF: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease which causes people to lose their sharp central vision over time. Aging damages the macula, which is in the middle of the retina - the light-sensitive part at the back of the eye. There are 2 types of AMD - wet AMD and dry AMD. The advanced stage of dry AMD causes vision loss. This is known as geographic atrophy. AMD makes everyday tasks like reading or driving difficult. ASP7317 is a potential new treatment for people with AMD. ASP7317 are human stem cells which have changed into cells found in the retina. ASP7317 is injected under the macula. It is hoped that ASP7317 will replace some of the damaged cells in the macula and improve vision for people with dry AMD. Before ASP7317 is available as a treatment, the researchers need to check its safety and how well it is tolerated. They will also check for signs of improved vision. People taking part in this study will be older people who have geographic atrophy caused by dry AMD. This is an open-label study. This means that people in this study and clinic staff will know that people will receive ASP7317. There will be 3 doses of ASP7317. These are low, medium and high numbers of cells. ASP7317 will be injected under the macula after the person is given either a local or a general anesthetic. To prevent the body from rejecting the cells, people will take tablets of tacrolimus a few days before receiving ASP7317 for up to a few weeks afterwards. Other medicines will be taken during this time to stop infections. There will be 2 groups in the study. Group 1 will be people with severe vision loss and Group 2 will be people with moderate vision loss. There will be different small groups of people within Group 1 and Group 2, with each small group receiving 1 of the 3 doses of ASP7317. Different small groups of people within Group 1 and Group 2 will receive lower to higher doses of ASP7317. Each small group will only receive 1 dose. Group 1 will start treatment first. At each dose, a medical expert panel will check the results of the first person in the group to decide if the rest of the group will receive the same dose. Then, the panel will decide if more people may receive the same dose or if the next group may receive the next highest dose. The panel will use the results from the lower dose of Group 1 to decide when Group 2 starts treatment (also at the lower dose). The panel will also use the results of the middle and higher doses in Group 1 to decide when and how many people in Group 2 can receive these doses. During the study, people will visit the clinic several times for up to 12 months (1 year). During all visits, the study doctors will check for any medical problems after receiving ASP7317. Vital signs will be checked a few days before treatment with ASP7317 and up to about a month afterwards. Vital signs include blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. At some visits, the study doctors will also take blood samples for blood tests. At most visits, people will have eye tests and have different images, scans, and measurements taken. This could be for the affected eye or both eyes, depending on the test.

COVID-19 poses a mortality risk of 3-7%, rising to 20% in older patients with co-morbidities. Of all infected patients, 15-20% will develop severe respiratory symptoms necessitating hospital admission. Around 5% of patients will require invasive mechanical ventilation, and up to 50% will die. Evidence in severe COVID-19 suggests that these patients experience cytokine storm and progressed rapidly with acute respiratory distress syndrome and eventual multi-organ failure. Early identification and immediate treatment of hyperinflammation is thus recommended to reduce mortality. Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) has been shown to be a myelopoietic growth factor that has pleiotropic effects in promoting the differentiation of immature precursors into polymorphonuclear neutrophils, monocytes/ macrophages and dendritic cells, and also in controlling the function of fully mature myeloid cells. It plays an important role in priming monocytes for production of proinflammatory cytokines under TLR and NLR stimulation. It has a broad impact on the processes driving DC differentiation and affects DC effector function at the mature state. Importantly, GM-CSF plays a critical role in host defense and stimulating antiviral immunity. Detailed studies have also shown that GM-CSF is necessary for the maturation of alveolar macrophages from foetal monocytes and the maintenance of these cells in adulthood. The known toxicology, pharmacologic and safety data also support the use of Leukine\u00ae in hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS due to COVID-19. This study aims to recruit patients with evidence of pneumonia and hypoxia who have increased risk for severe disease and need for mechanical ventilation. The overall hypothesis is that GM-CSF has antiviral immunity, can provide the stimulus to restore immune homeostasis in the lung with acute lung injury from COVID-19, and can promote lung repair mechanisms, which would lead to improvement in lung oxygenation parameters. ; DRUG USED: Leukine; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: COVID-19 Treatment; TARGET: Granulocyte Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor Receptor (GM-CSFR)/CD116; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Singapore General Hospital; PRIMARY OUTCOME: Measuring oxygenation; SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: ", "output": "Yes"}, {"instruction": "Predict if this trial will transition to the next phase.

When prostate cancer is confined to the prostate there is a high chance of cure. However, it is outside the prostate or comes back after treatment, additional therapy may be needed. Current methods of imaging prostate cancer are limited. Researchers want to see if a radiotracer called 18F-DCFPyL can identify prostate cancer in patients who have a high risk of cancer spreading outside the prostate or who have signs of recurrent cancer after treatment. Objectives: To see if the radiotracer 18F-DCFyL can help identify prostate cancer in the body before or after therapy. Eligibility: Men ages 18 and older who have prostate cancer that has been newly diagnosed, or has relapsed after radiation or surgery Design: Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will have blood taken. Participants will be divided into 2 groups. - Group 1 will be men with cancer that has been newly diagnosed as high risk by their doctor who are scheduled to have prostate removal surgery or undergo biopsy before radiation therapy. - Group 2 will be men who have presumed prostate cancer relapse after prostate removal surgery or radiation therapy. Both groups will have scans taken. Participants will lie still on a table in a machine that takes pictures of their body. 18F-DCFyL will be injected by intravenous (IV) line. Participants will be contacted for follow-up after scans. Participants in Group 1 may have surgery to remove their prostate gland or a biopsy to remove some prostate tissue. This procedure will be standard of care and is not a part of this study. They will also have an extra MRI scan of their prostate. For this, a tube, called an endorectal coil, will be placed in their rectum. Other tubes may be wrapped around the inside of their pelvis. A contrast agent will be given by IV. Participants in Group 2 may also undergo an MRI of the pelvis and may have a biopsy of abnormalities found on the 18F-DCFyL scan.

The PD-1 inhibitor being tested with ATP128 is the BI 754091 (Ezabenlimab) compound which belongs to the human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) subclass of antibodies. VSV-GP is a recombinant chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, Indiana strain Rhabdoviridae) which carries the envelope glycoprotein (GP) of the visceral non neurotropic WE-HPI strain of the Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV, Arenaviridae) instead of the native VSV glycoprotein (G) and is developed as integral part of the prime-boost regimen together with ATP128.

The tumor has grown despite attempts to control it with chemotherapy or radiation. Low grade gliomas are a group of tumors that tend to grow slowly and could be cured if every bit of the tumor were surgically removed. These tumors are called Grade I or II astrocytomas. These tumors often grow in parts of the brain that prevent total removal without devastating neurologic complications or death. Although some low grade gliomas never grow, most will and are treated with either chemotherapy or radiation. There is good data showing that the growth of most low grade gliomas can be controlled with chemotherapy or radiation. However, some low grade gliomas in children and young adults grow despite these treatments. Poly-ICLC is a new drug that has been used safely in children and adults with different types of brain tumors. Earlier studies showed that this drug worked better for children and young adults with low grade gliomas than for children with more aggressive brain tumors. The main purpose of this study is to use Poly-ICLC treatment in a larger number of patients to see how well it works and how many side effects occur. As Poly-ICLC is not FDA approved, this study is authorized to use it under Investigational New Drug (IND)# 43984, held by Oncovir. Subjects will get injections of Poly-ICLC into muscle two times weekly. The first treatments will be given in the clinic so allergic or other severe reactions, if any, can be monitored. If subjects tolerate the injections and don't have a severe reaction, then the rest of the injections will be given at home. Subjects/caregivers will be trained to give injections. Treatment will last for about 2 years. Subjects may stay on treatment for longer than 2 years if their tumor shrinks in response to the injections, if study doctors think it is safe, if subjects want to remain on treatment, and if Poly-ICLC is available. Risks: Poly-ICLC has been used safely in children and adults at the dose used in this study, and at higher doses. Frequently seen side effects include irritation of the skin at the injection site and mild flu-like symptoms.

While agitation may have various underlying causes, patients with schizophrenia are especially vulnerable to acute episodes of agitation, especially during exacerbation of disease, and clinicians do not always diagnose these episodes early enough. Agitation associated with psychosis is a frequent reason for emergency department visits, and unless it is recognized early and managed effectively, it can rapidly escalate to potentially dangerous behaviors, including physical violence. Educating psychiatric professionals about the timely and accurate diagnosis of agitation among patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and developing a well-tolerated easily administered medication will contribute to the prompt and effective management of this condition and could help reduce the risk of violent behavior and other undesirable outcomes.

Ganetespib is considered an \"HSP90 inhibitor\". By blocking HSP90, ganetespib is thought to reduce the ability of cancer cells to become resistant to treatment. Fulvestrant is a hormonal therapy that works by attaching to estrogen receptors. In doing so, it can block the effect of estrogen on cancer cells. In addition, fulvestrant causes a decrease in the number of estrogen receptors. Fulvestrant is a drug that is approved by the FDA for treatment of metastatic, hormone receptor positive breast cancer, based upon the results of phase III clinical trials. In the laboratory, adding ganetespib to fulvestrant appears to improve its effectiveness. It is not known whether this is true in humans.

No single way seems perfect for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from disease caused by bacteria or toxic substances. Antibodies work by binding those bacteria or substances, which stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that are infected. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most patients. This study is designed to combine both T cells and antibodies to create a more effective treatment called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted against the CD30 antigen (ATLCAR.CD30) administration. In previous studies, it has been shown that a new gene can be put into T cells that will increase their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. The new gene that is put in the T cells in this study makes an antibody called anti-CD30. This antibody sticks to lymphoma cells because of a substance on the outside of the cells called CD30. Anti-CD30 antibodies have been used to treat people with lymphoma, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients. For this study, the anti-CD30 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These CD30 chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells seem to kill some of the tumor, but they do not last very long in the body and so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown. The purpose of this research study is to establish a safe dose of ATLCAR.CD30 cells to infuse after lymphodepleting chemotherapy and to estimate the number patients whose cancer does not progress for two years after ATLCAR.CD30 administration. This study will also look at other effects of ATLCAR.CD30 cells, including their effect on the patient's cancer. ; DRUG USED: TT11 CD30 CAR-T; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Hodgkin's Lymphoma; TARGET: Autologous Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells (CAR-T), Cluster of Differentiation 30 (CD30) / TNFRSF8, Immune System; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center; PRIMARY OUTCOME: Number of participants with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability of ATLCAR.CD30 cells to establish a safe dose after lymphodepletion with bendamustine in adult patients; SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: 2 year overall survival (OS) after administration of CAR.CD30 transduced ATL following lymphodepletion with bendamustine and fludarabine in adult and pediatric patients with CD30+ relapsed/refractory HL and NHL.", "output": "No"}, {"instruction": "Predict if this trial will transition to the next phase.
