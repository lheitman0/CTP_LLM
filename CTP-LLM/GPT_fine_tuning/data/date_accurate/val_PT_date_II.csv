"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - ZEBRA - vs. Everolimus; BRIEF: When kidney cancer spreads beyond the kidney, it is known as metastatic kidney cancer. This is very difficult to treat and almost all patients will die of their disease within 2 years of the diagnosis. Sunitinib and other related drugs (e.g. pazopanib) have become standard therapy for untreated patients with metastatic kidney cancer. They target a growth factor known as VEGF which is important in treating kidney cancer. Although the results with this drug are impressive, patients develop resistance to the drug and stop therapy. It is currently standard practice is to give everolimus when resistance to sunitinib occurs; this is associated with clear clinical benefit. However the average time to cancer regrowth with everolimus is only 5 months. It is thought this might be because, everolimus only partially inhibits its target (TORC 1 and TORC 2). Therefore further improvement in treating patients is required. AZD2014 is a promising new drug which does inhibit both TORC 1 and TORC 2 and is therefore worthy of investigation in renal cancer as it theoretically could may have advantages over everolimus. Therefore study compares AZD2014 to everolimus in the setting where everolimus is used as standard of care. (e.g. in patients who have failed drug like sunitinib). The study is a randomised trial allowing us to quantify the benefit and potential for further development of AZD2014. Repeat Xrays (CT scans) will be used to assess if the new drug delays tumour growth. Patients will be closely followed up in clinic to ensure safety. A maximum of 122 patients will be recruited into this multi centre national trial. The primary goal of the study is to investigate if AZ2014 delays the time for cancer regrowth (time to progression) compared to everolimus. ; DRUG USED: Vistusertib; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Renal Cell Cancer (RCC); TARGET: Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR)/mTORC; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Queen Mary University of London; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase IIb; BRIEF: Arimoclomol is a small molecule that upregulates ""molecular chaperones"" in cells under stress. Arimoclomol extends survival by five weeks when given both pre-symptomatically and at disease onset in a mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD1) transgenic mouse model of ALS. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects in other rat models of nerve damage. Molecular chaperone proteins are critical in the cellular response to stress and protein misfolding. Recent data suggest that the SOD1 mutation responsible for ALS in some patients with familial disease reduces the availability of a variety of molecular chaperones, and thus weakens their ability to respond to cellular stress. Protein misfolding and consequent aggregation may play a role in the pathogenesis of both the familial and sporadic forms of ALS. Therapeutic agents such as arimoclomol that improve cellular chaperone response to protein misfolding may be helpful in ALS. ; DRUG USED: Miplyffa; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS); TARGET: SOD1; THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: CytRx; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Familial or sporadic ALS. - Diagnosed with laboratory-supported probable, probable or definite ALS according to the World Federation of Neurology El Escorial criteria for less than or equal to 36 months' duration prior to the Screening Visit. - Vital capacity (VC) equal to or greater than 70% predicted value for gender, height and age at the Screening Visit. - Geographic accessibility to the study site. - Ability to take oral medication at the Screening Visit, based on verbal report. - Fluency in English, Spanish or Canadian French.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - Norway; BRIEF: The aim of the study is to find out if the experimental medicine, YF476, can make gastric carcinoids, a rare type of stomach tumour, shrink and disappear. Gastric carcinoids occur mainly in patients with chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), a condition in which the acid-producing cells in the lining of the stomach can't make acid. Acid production is controlled by gastrin, a hormone (chemical messenger) that's released into the bloodstream. If the stomach can't make acid, blood levels of gastrin rise. High blood levels of gastrin in patients with CAG can cause other cells (ECL cells) in the lining of the stomach to grow and, over the years, to give rise to gastric carcinoids. Gastric carcinoids are usually benign, but they can become malignant. Therefore, patients with CAG and gastric carcinoids have the inside of their stomach checked regularly, by gastroscopy, to see if the gastric carcinoids need removing surgically. A gastroscope is a thin (1 cm), flexible tube at end of which is a mini video camera, which enables the user to inspect the lining of the stomach and a 'snare' to take samples of tissue (biopsies). YF476 (netazepide) is a gastrin receptor antagonist (blocks the effects of gastrin), so it's a potential new medical treatment for gastric carcinoids in patients with CAG. Up to 10 of these patients will take YF476 daily for up to 12 weeks. They'll make up to seven outpatient visits for tests, including checks on the safety of YF476 and up to four gastroscopies. At each gastroscopy, the gastric carcinoids will be measured and biopsies taken for laboratory tests. Patients will take up to 24 weeks to finish the study. ; DRUG USED: YF-476; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Gastric Cancer; TARGET: Cholecystokinin 2 (CCK2 or CCKB) / Gastrin receptor; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Trio Medicines Ltd.; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Patients known to have gastric carcinoids associated with chronic atrophic gastritis and hypergastrinaemia, and who attend the outpatient clinic of the investigator; - Men, postmenopausal women, premenopausal women who have been sterilised by tubal ligation, hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or premenopausal women using reliable contraception: condom and spermicide or intrauterine device; - Adults ≥ 18 years; - Good general health; and - Able to give fully-informed, written consent.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I/II - Europe (Servier); BRIEF: Co-selective inhibition of VEGFRs and FGFR has the potential benefit of blocking the two most relevant players in tumor angiogenesis and simultaneously targeting proliferation in FGF-driven tumors. Lucitanib is a novel dual-targeted small molecule inhibitor of VEGFR1, 2, 3 and FGFR1 showing strong anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity in preclinical models at well-tolerated oral doses, with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. These properties make it an attractive candidate for development in humans. This is an open-label, uncontrolled, non-randomized, PhaseI/IIa study and its primary objective is to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Lucitanib administered orally, once daily, on a continuous schedule over the initial 28-day cycle. Secondary objectives are to determine the safety profile, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and antitumour activity of Lucitanib, given as a single agent to adult patients with advanced solid tumours. The study consists of two phases, a dose escalation phase followed by a dose-expansion phase at the identified Recommended Dose (RD). Eligible patients have histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours, relapsed or refractory to standard therapy. For the dose expansion, patients should have tumours bearing FGFR1 or 11q 12-14 amplification, assessed by FISH or CGH array, or ""sensitive"" to antiangiogenic treatment. These latter are defined as patients who have relapsed after having experienced stable disease (lasting at least six months) or partial response with prior treatment with an approved antiangiogenic regimen or patients with tumour types known to be potentially responsive to antiangiogenic agents but without such pretreatment if no antiangiogenic agents were approved and/or available for that specific condition (e.g thyroid cancer, thymic carcinoma). Serial safety assessments, including evaluation of symptoms, physical examination and blood and urine laboratory analyses are performed throughout the study. Cardiac functions and blood pressure are monitored in consultation with a cardiologist. PK parameters are determined on plasma samples collected during the first 4-week cycle and analyzed using a validated LC-MS/MS method.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II w/Cisplatin + Pemetrexed; BRIEF: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase II study to compare a triplet combination of CBP501, pemetrexed and cisplatin with pemetrexed/cisplatin when administered to patients with locally advanced (stage IIIB with malignant pleural effusion or pericardial effusion) or metastatic (stage IV) non-squamous NSCLC as consecutive i.v. infusions according to a once-every-3-weeks schedule. The protocol will evaluate full-dose cisplatin and pemetrexed with or without CBP501. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to pemetrexed, cisplatin and CBP501 (Arm A) or pemetrexed and cisplatin (Arm B). Randomization will be stratified according to whether or not patients are eligible for bevacizumab therapy. Preclinical and clinical findings that support this protocol are: - CBP501 has exhibited interesting preclinical activity in various lung cancer cell lines. - Synergism was documented with CBP501/cisplatin in the preclinical studies with lung cancer cell lines. - The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of CBP501 was rapid onset allergic reaction, as was suggested by preclinical toxicology. Other toxicities were quite limited. No evidence of potentiation of either CBP501 or cisplatin toxicity was found in the combination phase I trial, and the toxicity of the combination, primarily related to cisplatin, is manageable. It is expected that CBP501 and pemetrexed will display non-overlapping toxicity profiles in combination, given that hematological toxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity are the principal toxicity types of the latter. - Given the acceptable safety of the cisplatin/ pemetrexed combination, it is anticipated that the addition of CBP501 to this combination can be evaluated without excessive risk in the phase II programs. - The phase I study of CBP501 in combination with pemetrexed/cisplatin (phase I part of the mesothelioma program) did not show DLTs or evidence of enhancement of toxicities with the triplet combination. The RD of CBP501 25 mg/m², cisplatin 75 mg/m² and pemetrexed 500 mg/m² is currently in use in the phase II study with first line mesothelioma patients. - Hints of activity were observed during the phase I study with CBP501 and cisplatin. - No pharmacokinetics (PK) interaction was documented between cisplatin and CBP501. ; DRUG USED: CBP501; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC); TARGET: Cell Cycle Checkpoint Kinase 1 (Chk1); THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: CanBas Co.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - Yonsei University; BRIEF: Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common cancer and more than 650,000 new cases are diagnosed each year worldwide. About 60% of the HNSCC patients present with unresectable locally advanced disease at diagnosis and treated with multimodality approach. Despite such approach, majority (70%) of patients develop local or/and regional recurrences. Additional 10% of patients present with distant metastasis at diagnosis. Most patients with recurrent or metastatic disease are treated with single agent chemotherapy, combination chemotherapy or targeted therapies. Despite its public health magnitude, HNSCC in Asian countries has received a limited attention for the drug development and cancer-related research. In fact, HNSCC ranked 7th among men and 10th among women by incidence in China, the largest producer and consumer of tobacco and alcohol. Recently, Chen et al. documented a 1:1:2 subset distribution for cancers of oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx in China, similar to the distribution reported in Korea but quite different from the general distribution of 5:2:3 in whites. Ethnic disparities in HNSCC also include its prognosis and this is partly explained by HPV-active disease ratio and genetic factors. Therefore, there is a strong need for an additional research in patients with HNSCC in Asia. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is often over-expressed, and have been related to poor prognosis in patients with HNSCC. The association between EGFR-activated signaling pathways and tumor cell survival are well documented in many studies. EGFR targeting strategies showed clinical anti-tumor efficacy in patients with HNSCC, especially with monoclonal antibody, cetuximab. In the Extreme study, it was shown that the addition of cetuximab to platinum-5-FU significantly prolonged the median overall survival from 7.4 months to 10.1 months compared to platinum-5FU alone in the first-line setting. HM781-36B is a irreversible pan-HER inhibitor. In preclinical studies, HM781-36B has much lower IC50 values than gefitinib in cell lines engineered to express EGFRvIII mutations and produces tumor growth inhibition in gefitinib-resistant xenografts. A phase I trial of HM781-36B in patients with advanced solid tumors showed clinically significant anti-tumor activity and a phase II trials of HM781-36B in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and advanced gastric cancer are currently ongoing. We suggest a phase II trial of HM781-36B in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC who are resistant or ineligible/intolerant to platinum-based chemotherapy. The aim of current trial is to evaluate the antitumor efficacy and safety profile of HM781-36B and to identify biomarker to predict the tumor response to HM781-36B. ; DRUG USED: Poziotinib; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Head and Neck Cancer; TARGET: EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), ErbB4/HER4, HER2/neu or ErbB-2; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Yonsei University; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - NMIBC TURBT HG (Israel); BRIEF: This study is a prospective randomized open labeled dose ranging comparative study. Twenty four (24) patients with NMIBC who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be recruited for the study following the initial diagnostic cystoscopy. The investigators believe that this study is of importance on several aspects: 1. It evaluates a new mode of bladder instillation that may bypass the drawbacks of the current instillation mode. 2. If proved effective, this mode of treatment might save the need for TURBT performance and serve as a new mode of tumor ablation. 3. Even if proved partially effective, this mode of treatment will diminish tumors size and/or number, thus enable a more limited TURBT procedure. 4. This mode of treatment will enable immediate medical attendance to the patient's tumor recurrence without the waiting period (resulting from queues in the medical centers) for TURBT. This might improve the patient's prognostic outcome. 5. If this experimental treatment will prove to have a better ablative effect in comparison to the standard of care known in the art, this could be translated to a better prophylactic effect of tumor recurrence. 6. Finding the minimal, yet optimal, effective dose for tumor ablation and tumor recurrence prevention will enable us to reduce adverse effects of higher drug dosage. ; DRUG USED: VesiGel; DRUG CLASS: Non-NME; INDICATION: Bladder Cancer; TARGET: DNA, Tumor Cells; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: UroGen Pharma Ltd.; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase IIa - SECURE; BRIEF: Ulcerative colitis (UC) represents one of the major entities of idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases which are defined as chronically relapsing inflammations of the gastrointestinal tract not due to specific pathogens. It is characterised by a superficial, continuous mucosal inflammation, which predominantly affects the large intestine. The clinical course is typically marked by periods of asymptomatic remission punctuated by unpredictable recurrent attacks. The symptoms of the patients are marked by persistent diarrhoea with severe faecal urgency and often incontinence, rectal bleeding, abdominal cramping and weight loss. Uncontrolled activation of mucosal effector T cells has been identified as the main pathogenic mechanism involved in the initiation and perpetuation of intestinal inflammatory reactions. Patients with moderate UC are initially treated with mesalazine, applied both orally and rectally. If symptoms do not improve, systemic corticosteroids are to be administered. Patients who do not respond to systemic corticosteroids may become eligible for treatment with a calcineurin inhibitor or an anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α antibody. Alternatively, patients may have to undergo major colorectal surgery. Patients who do not adequately respond to these treatment strategies exhibit serious drawbacks. Colorectal surgery may result in a severely compromised quality of life. Therefore, patients with moderate or severe UC may significantly benefit from new therapeutic alternatives. The transcription factor GATA-3 is an interesting target for a novel therapeutic strategy in UC. GATA-3 is the key regulation factor of Th2-driven immune responses. It is indispensable for the differentiation and activation of Th2 cells, integrates Th2 signals, and induces Th2 cytokine expression. Results of a recent clinical trial in children showed that GATA-3 is involved in the pathogenesis of the acute phase of UC. The investigational product SB012 contains the DNAzyme hgd40 that targets GATA-3. By cleaving GATA-3 mRNA hgd40 reduces specific cytokine production and thereby reduces key features of mucosal inflammation. DNAzymes are completely generated by chemical synthesis, not by use of any living organism and are therefore not biological drugs. This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the topical formulation SB012 available in a concentration of 7.5mg/ml hgd40 in 30ml PBS once daily as a ready-for-use enema in patients with active UC. ; DRUG USED: SB012; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Ulcerative Colitis (UC); TARGET: GATA3; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Sterna Biologicals GmbH & Co.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - CRD-002; BRIEF: ADHD has been associated with persistent deficits in the efficient allocation of attention and supports the notion that regulation of the cholinergic system may improve these cognitive deficits in ADHD. It has been suggested that the effects of nicotine are most pronounced on tasks that demand effortful processing (Rusted and Warburton 1994). In addition, a recent theory proposes that the cholinergic system allocates additional attentional resources during tasks that are demanding (i.e. sustained attention, set shifting, etc; Sarter and Bruno 1997). Thus it may be that in ADHD, cholinergic systems are under-responsive or under-developed and thus stimulation of nicotinic receptors via nicotinic agents may result in improved cognitive performance particularly on tests requiring effortful processing. ; DRUG USED: Bradanicline; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD); TARGET: Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor - a7 subtype &lt;br&gt;(a7 nAChR) ; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Targacept Inc.; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I/II - CARMYSAP (Elderly); BRIEF: Phase I/II trial of Carfilzomib plus melphalan and prednisone in elderly untreated patients with multiple myeloma. Nine: University Hospital of Nantes, University Hospital of Nancy, University Hospital of Lille, University Hospital of Tours, department Hospital of La Roche Sur Yon, University Hospital of Reims, University Hospital of Clermont-Ferrand, University Hospital of Toulouse, University Hospital of Dijon Newly diagnosed symptomatic Multiple Myeloma > 65 years. Treatment comprises an initial phase consisting of nine 6-week cycles of Carfilzomib on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 22, 23, 29, 30 (carfilzomib is administered at 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 2 of the first cycle and 20, 27, 36 or 45 mg/m2 thereafter) followed by a 12 day rest period (42-day cycle), in combination with oral Melphalan 9 mg/m² and oral prednisone 60mg/m², both on days 1 to 4. Phase I: Identification of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) Carfilzomib will be administered at a dose of 20mg/m² for all doses to the first cohort of 6 patients. If dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred in fewer than 2 of these patients, the next cohort of 6 patients (cohort 2) will receive a dose of 20/27 mg/m² where the 20 mg/m² dose is administered on Day 1 and 2 of Cycle 1 only and then 27 mg/m² for all subsequent doses. If DLTs occurred in fewer than 2 of the patients in cohort 2, the third cohort of 6 patients will receive a dose of 20/36 mg/m² where the 20 mg/m² dose is administered on Day 1 and 2 of Cycle 1 only and then 36 mg/m² for all subsequent doses. If DLTs occurred in fewer than 3 of the patients in cohort 3 the fourth cohort of 6 patients will receive a dose of 20/45 mg/m² where the 20 mg/m² dose is administered on Day 1 and 2 of Cycle 1 only and then 45 mg/m² for all subsequent doses. If at any time during cycle 1 of a dose cohort, ≥ 2 subjects experience a drug-related DLT, the MTD will have been exceeded, additional enrollment within the cohort will cease, and dose escalation will stop. The MTD will be defined as the dose level below which DLT is observed in ≥ 33% (i.e. ≥ 2 of 6) subjects in a cohort. The following are defined as DLTs: - Any hematologic toxicity of grade 4 intensity or preventing administration of 2 or more of the 8 carfilzomib doses of the first treatment cycle except a) grade 4 thrombocytopenia without bleeding lasting ≤ 7 days or b) grade 4 neutropenia lasting ≤ 7 days - Grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia - Grade ≥ 3 gastrointestinal toxicities (except for grade ≥ 3 nausea/ vomiting if the patient had not received adequate antiemetic prophylaxis) - Any other grade ≥ 3 nonhematologic toxicity considered related to CMP by the principal investigator. - Grade ≥ 3 peripheral neuropathy persisting for more than 3 weeks after discontinuation of study drugs. Adverse events (AEs) will be graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE, version 4.0). MTD determination will be based on occurrence of DLTs during the first induction treatment cycle only. Phase II: Expanded Cohort. After identification of the MTD, it is planned for the dose cohort to be expanded to include up to a total of 20 patients treated at the MTD for the phase II part of the study. A full treatment course is the same as for phase I: nine 6-week cycles of CMP. PRIMARY ENDPOINT Phase I: MTD of combination Phase II: Overall response rate [(ORR), consisting of complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), and partial response (PR) SECONDARY ENDPOINTS Safety and tolerability of CMP Clinical benefit response [(CBR = ORR + minimal response (MR)], Progression-free survival (PFS), Duration of response Overall survival (OS). Safety data analysis will be conducted on all subjects receiving at least one dose of study treatment. Analyses will consist of data summaries for reported AEs. The number and percentage of subjects experiencing one or more AEs will be summarized by dose, relationship to study drugs, and severity. AEs will be coded using MedDRA terminology. Disease Response Analyses: Overall response rate (ORR = CR + VGPR + PR) to treatment will be measured using the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. Clinical benefit response (CBR = ORR + MR) will be determined using minimal response (at least 6 weeks duration) as defined by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT). The distribution of subjects by response category will be made overall and by dose cohort. Time-to-event endpoints will be evaluated with the use of the Kaplan-Meier method and plots will be provided.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - High-risk Smoldering MM (NCI); BRIEF: Background: - Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is a condition that can lead to multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer. In many high-risk cases, SMM can develop into multiple myeloma in less than 2 years. The current standard of care for SMM is follow-up without treatment until multiple myeloma develops. However, some drugs are being studied to see if they can slow down or prevent the disease from progressing. One such drug is MLN9708. It has shown some results against multiple myeloma. Researchers want to combine MLN9708 with dexamethasone to see how it works against high-risk SMM. Objectives: - To see if MLN9708 with dexamethasone is a safe and effective treatment for high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma. Design: - Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected. Imaging studies and a bone marrow biopsy may also be performed. - Participants will take MLN9708 and dexamethasone on a regular schedule for 28 days. They will take each drug four times at regular intervals during each cycle of treatment. - Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies. - Participants will have 12 cycles of treatment. After four cycles, patients will be recommended to have their own stem cells collected and stored. This will allow the potential application of a highdose melpahalan/autologous stem cell transplant in the event there is a need in the future (not part of this study). - After 12 cycles, participants will keep taking MLN9708 as long as the disease does not progress and the side effects are not too severe. ; DRUG USED: Ninlaro; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Multiple Myeloma (MM); TARGET: Proteasome; THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: National Cancer Institute (NCI); CRITERIA: - INCLUSION CRITERIA: - Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed Smoldering Multiple Myeloma confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology, NCI based on the International Myeloma Working Group Criteria: - Serum M-protein greater than or equal to 3 g/dl and/or bone marrow plasma cells greater than or equal to 10 %, - Absence of anemia: Hemoglobin >10 g/dl - Absence of renal failure: calculated creatinine clearance (according to MDRD) > 80 ml/min (or alternatively based on standard creatinine level criteria of 2 mg/dl) - Absence of hypercalcemia: Ca < 10.5 mg/dl or less than or equal to 2.5 mmol/L - Absence of lytic bone lesion - High-risk SMM per Mayo Clinic2 or Spanish PETHEMA1 criteria - Measurable disease within the past 4 weeks defined by any one of the following: - Serum monoclonal protein greater than or equal to 1.0 g/dl - Urine monoclonal protein >200 mg/24 hour - Serum immunoglobulin free light chain >10 mg/dL AND abnormal kappa/lambda ratio (reference 0.26-1.65) - Age >18 years. - ECOG performance status <2. - Ability to give informed consent. - Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: - absolute neutrophil count >1.0 K/uL - Platelets >75 K/uL (Platelet transfusions to help patients meet eligibility criteria are not allowed within 3 days before study enrollment.) - hemoglobin > 8 g/dL(transfusions are permissible) - total bilirubin <1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal - AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) < 3.0 X institutional upper limit of normal - Female patients who: - Are postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the Screening visit, OR - Are surgically sterile, OR - If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2 effective methods of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, OR agree to completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse. - The 2 methods of reliable contraception must include 1 highly effective method and 1 additional effective (barrier) method.

Staphylococcus aureus is a human pathogenic bacterium that causes severe infections, including pneumonia and sepsis. Hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) caused by S. aureus, including ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) in mechanically ventilated subjects, is a significant public health threat despite efforts to optimize antibiotic treatment. ASN100 is an investigational monoclonal antibody product that targets the toxins produced by S. aureus to protect subjects from developing S. aureus pneumonia. ; DRUG USED: ASN100; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Staphylococcal Vaccines and Other Staphylococcus-Specific Agents (Antibacterial); TARGET: Alpha-hemolysin (Hla), Gamma-hemolysin, LukGH, Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Arsanis, Inc.; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Subject is currently hospitalized and is mechanically ventilated endotracheally (i.e., orotracheal or nasotracheal) and, in the Investigator's opinion, will require ongoing ventilator support for at least 48 hours; Exclusion Criteria: - Subject has a chest X-ray or thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan that is definitive for a diagnosis of pneumonia - Subject has a known and documented ETA culture showing heavy colonization with a -Gram-negative organism at enrollment or at any time during the Screening period; - Significant Neutropenia - Severe non-pulmonary source of infection. - Subjects with a known history or current (suspected) diagnosis of cytokine release syndrome associated with the administration of peptides, proteins, and/or antibodies. ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: Efficacy of a Single Intravenous (IV) Dose of ASN100; SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: Duration of Mechanical Ventilation",No
"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - 30 Min Infusion; BRIEF: The purpose of this study is to test a new drug called carfilzomib. It is a type of drug called a proteasome inhibitor. Proteasome breaks down proteins that are no longer useful to the cell. When the proteasome is turned off by a drug (like carfilzomib), useless proteins cannot be broken down. Instead the proteins build up and cause the cell to die. Myeloma cells make a lot of protein and are especially in need of a functional proteasome to survive. Carfilzomib is not approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration to treat myeloma. It is considered an experimental drug. Previous studies have shown that carfilzomib is safe to use. This study will look at what the effects, good and/or bad, carfilzomib has on myeloma. ; DRUG USED: Kyprolis; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Multiple Myeloma (MM); TARGET: Proteasome; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Participants must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible to enroll in this study. - Patients meeting the criteria for symptomatic multiple myeloma that has relapsed or is refractory to at least 2 prior lines of therapy. - Previous therapy with bortezomib. - Previous therapy with thalidomide or lenalidomide. - Patients must have measurable disease and therefore must have at least one of the following: Serum M-protein ≥1 gm/dL (≥10 gm/L) Urine M-protein ≥200 mg/24 hr Serum FLC assay: involved FLC ≥10 mg/dL (≥100 mg/L) provided serum FLC ratio is abnormal. - Age ≥ 18 years - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2 Adequate hepatic function, with serum ALT ≤ 3.5 times the upper limit of normal and serum direct bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL (34 µmol/L) within 14 days prior to enrollment - Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.0 × 109/L within 14 days prior to enrollment Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL (80 g/L) within 14 days prior to enrollment (participants may be receiving red blood cell [RBC] transfusions in accordance with institutional guidelines) - Platelet count ≥ 50 × 109/L (≥ 30 × 109/L if thought to be secondary to myeloma involvement of the bone marrow ) within 14 days prior to enrollment (platelet transfusions are allowed) - Creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 15 mL/minute within 14 days prior to enrollment, either estimated or calculated using a standard formula (eg, Cockcroft and Gault) - Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing and to practice contraception. - Male participants must agree to practice contraception.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - Germany & UK; BRIEF: For many patients taking opioids for pain relief one of the most distressing side effects is constipation. Naloxone is effective in the reversal of the effects of opioids and is used following opioid overdose. If naloxone is given by mouth it would relieve the effects of constipation but as it goes into the blood stream very quickly, it would also reverse the effects of the opioid and therefore stop the pain relief. The aim of this study is to examine a slow release formulation of naloxone to see if is can reduce constipation without reducing the pain relieving effects of the opioid. ; DRUG USED: Nalcol; DRUG CLASS: Non-NME; INDICATION: Opioid Induced Constipation (OIC); TARGET: Opioid receptors; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: S.L.A.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - Moderate Persistant; BRIEF: Rationale for the current trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three doses (1.25 µg, 2.5 µg and 5.0 µg ex mouthpiece) of tiotropium inhalation solution in patients with moderate persistent asthma who are still symptomatic despite regular maintenance therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). The data collected in the present trial will provide useful information to health care providers and patients regarding the efficacy and safety of a once daily inhalation of three different doses of tiotropium solution delivered by the Respimat® inhaler in addition to inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of not fully controlled moderate asthma in comparison to placebo. The Pharmacokinetics (PK) of tiotropium is well established in COPD patients. However, there is currently no PK data available for the 3 doses of tiotropium being tested in this trial in patients with moderate persistent asthma. Tiotropium is a once daily drug. Hence, the rationale for blood and urine sampling for PK analysis over 24 hours in a subset of patients is to confirm the PK of the 3 doses in moderate asthma patients. Rationale for the 24-hour pulmonary function test sub-investigation is to demonstrate that a once daily dosing of tiotropium inhalation solution is effective and safe in the treatment of moderate persistent asthma. ; DRUG USED: Spiriva; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Asthma; TARGET: Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Boehringer Ingelheim; CRITERIA: Inclusion criteria: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase IIa - BRONC01.01; BRIEF: Prospective, Double Blind, Randomized Single-Center, Evaluation of Safety and Tolerability of Nitric Oxide Given Intermittently via Inhalation to Subjects with Bronchiolitis-Phase IIa Bronchiolitis is defined as an infection of the small airways. It is also the most common manifestation of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in early infancy, and is the leading cause of global child mortality. NO has been shown to play a critical role in various biological functions, including the vasodilatation of smooth muscle, neurotransmission, regulation of wound healing and immune responses to infection such as microbicidal action directed toward various organisms. NO in the airways is considered to play a key role in the innate immune system in which the first-line of host defense against microbes is built. It has shown the beneficial effect of NO in different diseases with several options of doses and regimens - from newborn with primary pulmonary hypertension which showed improvement in oxygenation after 30 minutes of NO treatment at 10-20 ppm, to a subject with adult respiratory distress syndrome, who demonstrated clinical improvement during NO treatment at 18 and 36 ppm. In vitro studies utilizing a variety of nitric oxide (NO) donors suggested that NO, in part per million (ppm) concentrations, possesses antimicrobial and anti-viral activity against a wide variety of phyla including bacteria, viruses, helminthes and parasites. Primary Objectives: Assess the safety of NO intermittent inhalation treatment in 2-12 month old bronchiolitis subjects. Assess the tolerability of NO intermittent inhalation treatment in 2-12 month old bronchiolitis subjects Secondary Objective: Assess the efficacy of NO intermittent inhalation treatment compared to standard treatment in 2-12 months old bronchiolitis subjects. Prospective, double blind, randomized single-Center study of 44 hospitalized subjects aged 2 -12 months old, diagnosed with bronchiolitis will be enrolled into the study and randomized into 2 groups. Group 1 -Treatment group - Will receive nitric oxide inhalation in addition to standard treatment for up to 5 days, Group 2 - will receive ongoing inhalation of the standard treatment for 5 days. Treatment administration: Treatment blindness will be kept by separating between unblinded team members (giving the actual treatment) and blinded team members, and by hiding the NO container and all study related equipment behind a curtain. Between study inhalations the subject will continue to receive the standard inhalation treatment. Oxygen (O2), NO , nitrogen dioxide(NO2)and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) delivered to the patient will be continuously monitored. All subjects will come for follow up visits on day 7(+5), 14 (+5) days and will be contacted on day 30 (+5) from day of admission to the department. End of study treatment (both groups) will be assessed by a blinded study physician base on clinical assessment.

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving triapine together with cisplatin may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. ; DRUG USED: Triapine; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Cervical Cancer; TARGET: Ribonucleotide Reductase (RNR);

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - TRIAC-1; BRIEF: This therapeutical trial will be conducted in patients with the Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome (AHDS), which is mutations in MCT8. MCT8 is a thyroid hormone (TH) transporter which is crucial for the transport of TH from the blood into different tissues. Dysfunction of MCT8 results in a lack of TH (hypothyroidism) in tissues that depend on MCT8 for TH uptake. This local hypothyroidism in the brain of these patients causes severe psychomotor retardation. In addition, TH serum parameters are highly abnormal in AHDS: high T3, low T4 and normal TSH levels. The high serum T3 levels cause local hyperthyroidism in tissues that do not depend on MCT8 for cellular transport of TH, resulting in a low body weight and reduced muscle mass. Currently, no adequate treatment is available for the AHDS. A T3 analog that does not depend on MCT8 for its cellular entry could, at least partially, restore the abnormalities found in AHDS. Several in vivo, in vitro and animal studies have shown that the T3 analog Triac is a very promising candidate: 1. Triac binds to the same TH receptors as T3; 2. Cellular uptake of Triac does not depend on functional MCT8. Hence, in AHDS patients Triac will also be available in tissues that require functional MCT8 for TH uptake, e.g. the brain; 3. In vitro studies have shown that neuronal cells differentiate equally well in the presence of either Triac or T3; 4. In Mct8 deficient mice, Triac is taken up by the brain and suppresses serum TSH levels; consequently, serum T3 and T4 levels were lowered; 5. Triac is the treatment of choice in patient with the resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) syndrome. Patient with RTH have high serum TSH and thyroid hormone levels, which shows strong similarities to the profile found in AHDS patients; the longstanding experience with Triac in RTH indicates its safety and tolerability . Thus, Triac treatment could result in normalization of the abnormal serum TH values in AHDS patients. Furthermore, Triac could replace the function of T3 in tissues that depend on MCT8 for TH uptake (e.g. brain). The current trial will investigate if Triac treatment in ADHS patients 1. reduces the toxic effects of the high T3 levels 2. restores the local TH deficiency in brain. ; DRUG USED: Emcitate; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Endocrine Disorder; TARGET: Thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Erasmus Medical Center; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - clinically relevant mutation in the MCT8 gene, resulting in the clinical phenotype of AHDS.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - GEN-01 (w/Zelboraf, Bevacizumab); BRIEF: This phase 2 clinical trial randomizes patients with BRAF mutant melanoma to either (1) standard of care (SOC) - BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in combination with MEK inhibitor cobimetinib; or, (2) SOC plus bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody that suppresses new blood vessel formation and can stimulate the immune system. Previous clinical studies in melanoma have shown that bevacizumab may improve clinical benefit (progression free survival) if combined with ipilimumab or abraxane. Preclinical studies suggest that VEGF increase plays a role in resistance to BRAF inhibitors. This randomized study will ask whether the addition of bevacizumab to targeted therapy SOC in BRAF mutant melanoma can improve response rates and clinical benefit. Patients may have received no therapy for advanced disease or up to 2 prior therapies, excluding BRAF and MEK inhibitors. ; DRUG USED: Cotellic; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Melanoma; TARGET: Mitogen-activated ERK kinase (MEK, MAPKK, MAP2K); THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: Melanoma Research Foundation Breakthrough Consortium; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: 1.

The central pathology review may take place prior to or after the participant starts treatment with lenvatinib. 1. Central review of pathology is required for study participation, but not required prior to enrollment or start of treatment in order to avoid delay. If the results of central pathology review are not available prior to the start of study treatment, the confirmation of diagnosis of ATC at the local laboratory is mandatory prior to scheduled start of treatment with lenvatinib. 2. If central pathology review indicates a diagnosis other than ATC, the participant may continue treatment with lenvatinib per standard of care, at the discretion of the treating investigator. Participants deemed to have another diagnosis (not ATC) will be taken off this study and replaced for the purpose of efficacy analyses. 3. Differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) with focus loci of ATC is allowed. If a participant has pathology showing a small focus of ATC arising out of DTC and the measurable disease is not fully consistent with ATC, confirmation of ATC by biopsy is required. 4. An incidental focus of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), DTC, and/or poorly differentiated thyroid cancer in a participant with ATC is allowed. 5.

This clinical trial will be the first evaluation of ONC201 in humans and will enroll patients with advanced cancer. This trial includes a phase I portion that will evaluate the safety of ONC201 and the recommended dose for the phase II portion. The phase II portion will evaluate the initial efficacy profile of ONC201 in select types of cancer. ; DRUG USED: ONC201; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Solid Tumors; TARGET: Dopamine 2 (D2) Receptor; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Chimerix; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: 1. Patients must have histologically confirmed glioblastoma multiforme, triple-negative breast cancer, colorectal cancer, or non-small cell lung cancer patients with advanced disease and limited therapeutic options. 2. Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥20 mm with conventional techniques or as ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. For lymph nodes to be considered measurable, the short axis must be ≥15 mm when assessed by CT scan. All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non-measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered non-measurable. See Section 11 for the evaluation of measurable disease. 3. Patients are eligible for enrollment if they have not had prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, anticancer therapy, or investigational agent within 28 days prior to the first dose (Week 1, Day 1); 42 days weeks in the case of alkylating agents. Patients are eligible for enrollment if they have had no surgery within 6 weeks prior to the first dose. Any number of prior therapies is allowable. 4. All adverse events Grade > 1 related to prior therapies (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and/or surgery) must be resolved, except for alopecia. 5. Age ≥18 years. 6. ECOG performance status ≤ 2 (Karnofsky ≥ 60%, see Appendix A). 7. Life expectancy of greater than 10 weeks. 8.

Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements 5. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ONC201 is novel agent with unknown potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ONC201, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ONC201. 6. Patients with a known HIV-positive test on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible for the initial first-in-man trial because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with ONC201. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated. 7. Patients with known history of cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, tachyarrhythmias or bradycardia will be excluded. Patients receiving therapeutic agents known to prolong QT interval will be excluded. Patients with history of CHF, or MI or stroke in the last 3 months will be excluded. Patients with a history of seizures will be excluded form the initial trial because ONC201 crosses the blood-brain barrier and this may affect their anti-seizure therapy. 8.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - 03; BRIEF: This is a Phase II trial to study the safety and efficacy of IMMU-130. IMMU-130 is composed of a drug attached to an antibody. The drug is the active ingredient in irinotecan which is a common chemotherapy drug used for colorectal cancer. Antibodies are proteins normally made by the immune system. They bind to substances that don't belong in the body to prevent harm to the body. The antibody in this study was designed to bind to a marker located on colorectal cancer tumors. The antibody was originally made from mouse proteins, but was changed in the laboratory to be more like human antibodies. This study will investigate how IMMU-130 acts for the treatment of colorectal cancer. The study is mainly being done to see if IMMU-130 is safe and effective. ; DRUG USED: Labetuzumab-SN-38; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Colorectal Cancer (CRC); TARGET: Antibody-drug Conjugate (ADC), Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), Topoisomerase I (Topo-I); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Gilead Sciences; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Male or female patients, ≥ 18 years of age, able to understand and give written informed consent - Histologically or cytologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma - Stage IV (metastatic) disease - Previously treated with at least one prior irinotecan-containing regimen for colorectal cancer - Adequate performance status (ECOG 0 or 1) (Appendix 1) - Expected survival ≥ 6 months - CEA plasma levels > 5 ng/mL - Measurable disease by CT or MRI, but with no single lesion measuring more than 10.0 cm - At least 4 weeks beyond treatment (chemotherapy, immunotherapy and/or radiation therapy) or major surgery and recovered from all acute toxicities - Adequate hematology without ongoing transfusional support (hemoglobin > 8 g/dL, ANC ≥ 1,500 per mm3, platelets > 100,000 per mm3) - Adequate renal and hepatic function (creatinine ≤ 1.5 x IULN, bilirubin within normal limits, AST and ALT ≤ 3.0 x IULN or 5 x IULN if know liver metastases) - Otherwise, all acute toxicity at study entry ≤ Grade 1 by NCI CTC v4.0, or recovered to baseline Exclusion Criteria: - Women who are pregnant or lactating. - Women of childbearing potential and fertile men unwilling to use effective contraception during study until conclusion of 12-week post-treatment evaluation period. - Patients with Gilbert's disease or known CNS metastatic disease.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - Dana Farber Cancer Institute; BRIEF: This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the effectiveness of an investigational drug, PCI-32765, to learn whether PCI-32765 works in treating a specific cancer. ""Investigational"" means that PCI-32765 is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to use, the side effects it may cause, and if PCI-32765 is effective for treating different types of cancer. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved PCI-32765 for use in patients, including people with Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia. PCI-32765 is a newly discovered drug that is being developed as an anti-cancer agent.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - VAC046 (w/Rabies Vaccine); BRIEF: Malaria transmission is falling in some parts of Africa as bed nets and anti-malarials become more widely available. However, transmission still persists and it appears that additional control measures are required. The leading malaria vaccine candidate in development is RTS,S which has efficacy against clinical malaria measured at 30-50% in the field. This partial protection might be enhanced by combination with other components. The other vaccination approach that has produced repeatable efficacy in humans is the use of viral vectors to induce T cell responses. Previous attempts with this vaccine approach have been effective in challenge studies in Oxford, but ineffective in the field, probably because of reduced immunogenicity. Recently, studies in Oxford, Kenya and the Gambia have shown higher levels of immunogenicity by using a chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd63) followed by an attenuated vaccinia virus (modified vaccinia Ankara) to deliver the pre-erythrocytic antigen, multiple epitope string with thrombospondin- related adhesion protein (ME-TRAP). The increase in immunogenicity has lead to sterile protection in 3 out of 14 volunteers and partial protection in 5 out of 14 volunteers in challenge studies. The investigators propose a Phase 2b study of 120 healthy adult men in Kenya. The investigators will assess the efficacy and further evaluate the immunogenicity and safety profile of the vaccine regimen. The investigators also intend to assess the correlates of efficacy and natural immunity. ; DRUG USED: Malaria Vaccine (Okairos); DRUG CLASS: Vaccine; INDICATION: Malaria; TARGET: Immune System; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: University of Oxford; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Consenting adult males aged 18 - 50 years in good health. - Will remain resident in the study area for the study duration. - Able and willing (in the Investigator's opinion) to comply with all study requirements - Informed Consent Exclusion Criteria: - Any significant medical disease, disorder or finding which may significantly increase the risk to the volunteer because of participation in the study, affect the ability of the volunteer to participate in the study or impair interpretation of the study data - Hypersensitivity to Verorab, the trial vaccines or the antimalarial used. - History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines, e.g. egg products, kathon, neomycin - History of splenectomy. - Haemoglobin less than 10.0 g/dl - Clinically significant abnormalities of laboratory screening tests (full blood count, ALT, creatinine levels). - Blood transfusion within the month preceding enrolment. - History of vaccination with previous experimental malaria vaccines or other vaccines likely to impact on findings of study (e.g. other MVA or adenovirus vectored vaccines) - Administration of any other vaccine or immunoglobulin within 2 weeks before vaccination. - HIV or Hepatitis B surface antigen seropositivity. - Current participation in another clinical trial or recent participation within 12 weeks of this study. - Any other finding which in the opinion of the investigators would increase the risk of an adverse outcome from participation in the trial. - Likelihood of travel away from the study area ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: Vaccine Efficacy; SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: Vaccine immunogenicity",No

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - 201 (MPN-Related); BRIEF: Anagrelide is a drug that has been shown to slow down how fast platelets are made in the bone marrow, and has been approved by the FDA for treating high platelets counts in patients with bone marrow disorders. Anagrelide Controlled Release (""CR"") is a new preparation of anagrelide that is made to dissolve more slowly than currently marketed versions of this drug. Because of this, the anagrelide is taken up into the blood more slowly. Researchers think that this slower release of the drug could help to lower side effects that might be caused by high blood levels when the drug dissolves as quickly as it does with the currently marketed product. The main purposes of this study are to see how well Anagrelide CR can control platelet counts in patients with high platelet levels, to see what kind of side effects it causes, and to measure blood levels of the drug. ; DRUG USED: GALE-401; DRUG CLASS: Non-NME; INDICATION: Essential Thrombocythemia (ET); TARGET: Platelets; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Galena Biopharma, Inc.; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - Extension (Israel); BRIEF: At a previous study the investigators have assessed the safety and efficacy of treatment with AAT(Alpha 1 Antitrypsin)in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes subjects aiming at beta cells preservation . Since treatment with AAT is expected to be a chronic treatment; stopping treatment will probably result in eventual loss of the preserved beta-cell function. Indeed, other investigational drugs aiming at beta cells preservation have shown that patients who were initially treated and maintained their initial beta-cell function, required continuation of treatment or they lost the beta-cell function. Therefore, in this extension study, patients who were previously treated with AAT and maintained clinically significant beta-cell function are offered a continuation of treatment, since they are likely to benefit from use of the medication. The proposed study is aimed to assess the long term effect of AAT in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus: safety and tolerability of treatment, and effect on beta-cell function.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I/II - 1114 (Columbia); BRIEF: The intravesical treatment of bladder cancer with Abraxane is more desirable than other taxanes due to its ability to be diluted in water and not lipid-based solutions allowing it greater access to sites in the bladder. Thus, we are interested in investigating Abraxane's safety, toxicity, and efficacy profile for the treatment of recurrent transitional cell cancer of the urinary bladder in a combined phase I & II trial. The phase I trial is designed as a dose-escalation study with cohorts of threes that will enroll a maximum of 18 patients. Dose increases will occur in groups of three patients, with each successive group receiving an increased concentration of Abraxane intravesically. No dose increase will occur until each member of the previous cohort has undergone the first instillation of the medication without experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Any patient who experiences a DLT will be removed from the trial and treated appropriately. If one patient in the cohort experiences a DLT an additional three patients will be enrolled and treated at that dose-level. If none of the additional three patients experience a DLT, the next group of patients will be started on the next higher dose level. If at any dose level, two or more patients experience a DLT the previous dose level will be considered as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). An additional three patients (for a total of six patients) will then be treated at the MTD. If less than two patients experience a DLT this dose level will be established as the MTD. The phase II aspect is designed in a Simon II stage format in which to satisfy our study powering, the first stage there will be 10 patients enrolled. If there are 2 or more successful treatments in that group (negative urine cytology and bladder biopsy after 6 months), then the first stage will pass the rejection rule, and up to another 19 patients will be enrolled. If at any point in the study, there have been a total of 6 or more successes, then the phase II aspect will be considered a successful trial and the study will be completed at that point. ; DRUG USED: Abraxane; DRUG CLASS: Non-NME; INDICATION: Bladder Cancer; TARGET: Microtubules (Tubulin); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Columbia University; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Patients must have a diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder confirmed at the study institution.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - +/- Daclizumab; BRIEF: This study will determine 1) the safety of AC2993 in patients with type I diabetes; 2) the ability of AC2993 to improve beta cell function; and 3) the effects of immunosuppression on beta cell function. Type I diabetes is an autoimmune disease, in which the immune system attacks the beta cells of the pancreas. These cells produce insulin, which regulates blood sugar. AC2993 may improve the pancreas's ability to produce insulin and help control blood sugar, but it may also activate the original immune response that caused the diabetes. Thus, this study will examine the effects of AC2993 alone as well as in combination with immunosuppressive drugs. Patients between 18 and 60 years of age who have type I diabetes mellitus may be eligible for this 20-month study. They must have had diabetes for at least 5 years and require insulin treatment. Candidates will be screened with a questionnaire, followed by medical history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, a chest x-ray and skin test for tuberculosis, electrocardiogram (EKG), and arginine stimulated C-peptide test (see description below). Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures: Advanced screening phase: Participants undergo a diabetes education program, including instruction on frequent blood glucose monitoring, dietary education on counting carbohydrates, intensive insulin therapy, review of signs and symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), and potential treatment with glucagon shots. Patients must administer insulin via an insulin pump or take at least four injections per day including glargine (Lantus) insulin. 4-month run-in phase - Arginine-stimulated C-peptide test: This test measures the body's insulin production. The patient is injected with a liquid containing arginine, a normal constituent of food that increases insulin release from beta cells into the blood stream. After the injection, seven blood samples are collected over 10 minutes. - Mixed meal stimulated C-peptide test with acetaminophen: This test assesses the response of the beta cells to an ordinary meal and the time it takes for food to pass through the stomach. The patient drinks a food supplement and takes acetaminophen (Tylenol). Blood samples are then drawn through a catheter (plastic tube placed in a vein) every 30 minutes for 4 hours to measure levels of various hormones and the concentration of acetaminophen. - Euglycemic clamp: This test measures the body's level of insulin resistance by measuring the amount of glucose necessary to compensate for an increased insulin level while maintaining a prespecified blood glucose level. ; DRUG USED: Byetta; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Diabetes Mellitus, Type I; TARGET: GLP-1 Receptor; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: AstraZeneca; CRITERIA: - INCLUSION CRITERIA: T1DM for at least 5 years as defined by the following: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase IIa - Columbia/NIDA (Opioid); BRIEF: Opioid drugs increase glial cell activation which may be related to the abuse liability of opioid drugs. Data supporting this hypothesis have demonstrated that glial cell attenuators decrease the positive rewarding aspect of opioids in laboratory animals. Ibudilast (MN-166, formerly AV411) is a compound that inhibits the activation of glia. Recent preclinical studies demonstrate that while ibudilast increases the analgesic effects of opioids, it decreases the rewarding effects of such drugs. It has also been shown that ibudilast suppresses morphine-induced release of dopamine, a primary neurotransmitter involved in the rewarding and reinforcing effects of abused drugs. Additionally, we recently found that ibudilast decreases subjective symptoms of opioid withdrawal in opioid dependent humans during detoxification. Therefore, the primary aim of this 6-7 week inpatient study is to investigate the ability of MN-166 to dose-dependently alter the reinforcing, analgesic, subjective, performance, and physiological effects of oxycodone, a commonly abused prescription opioid. This study includes a 10-day morphine taper phase, followed by two study phases (approximately 18 days each) with daily active ibudilast and placebo administration, respectively. After the detoxification phase, participants are randomized to receive placebo or MN-166, and then be stabilized on the medication. Thereafter, participants will complete laboratory sessions. Subsequently, during Phase 2, participants will cross over to the other treatment arm, stabilize, and complete laboratory sessions. ; DRUG USED: MN-166; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Substance Use Disorder; TARGET: Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF), Phosphodiesterase 10 (PDE10) , Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: New York State Psychiatric Institute; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Adults between the ages of 21 and 55 - Current opioid dependence according to DSM-IV criteria - currently not seeking treatment Exclusion Criteria: - Female patients that are currently pregnant, or breastfeeding.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - w/Aldesleukin (NCI); BRIEF: Background: The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy for treating patients with cancer that involves taking white blood cells from the patient, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, genetically modifying them, and then giving the cells back to the patient. In a previous study the NCI Surgery Branch used the anti-ESO-1 gene and a type of virus (retrovirus) to make these tumor fighting cells (anti-ESO-1 cells). About half of the patients who received this treatment experienced shrinking of their tumors. In this study, we are using a slightly different method of producing the anti-ESO-1 cells which we hope will be better in making the tumors shrink. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to see if these tumor fighting cells (genetically modified cells) that express the receptor for the ESO-1 molecule on their surface can cause tumors to shrink and to see if this treatment is safe. Eligibility: - Patients 15 years old and older with cancer that has the ESO-1 molecule on their tumors. Design: - Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed - Leukapheresis: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti ESO-1 cells. {Leukapheresis is a common procedure which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.} - Treatment: Once their cells have grown the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy, the anti-ESO-1 cells and aldesleukin. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment. - Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits take up to 2 days. ; DRUG USED: NY-ESO-1 (Kite); DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Solid Tumors; TARGET: NY-ESO-1 (Cancer-testis antigen), Stem Cells/Other Cell Therapies, T-Cell Receptor (TCR); THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: National Cancer Institute (NCI); CRITERIA: - INCLUSION CRITERIA - PATIENTS WITH SOLID TUMOR CANCERS AND MELANOMA: - Measurable (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.0 criteria) metastatic cancer or locally advanced refractory/recurrent malignancy including melanoma that expresses ESO as assessed by one of the following methods: reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on tumor tissue, immunohistochemistry of resected tissue, or serum antibody reactive with ESO. - Confirmation of diagnosis of metastatic cancer including melanoma by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Laboratory of Pathology. - Patients must have previously received first-line standard therapy (or effective salvage chemotherapy regimens) for metastatic disease, if known to be effective for that disease, and have been either non-responders (progressive disease) or have recurred. - Patients with 3 or fewer brain metastases that are less than 1 cm in diameter and asymptomatic are eligible.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - Women with Fat Accumulation; BRIEF: Ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI) regimens have become a backbone for treatment of people with HIV. However, adverse drug effects, particularly lipodystrophy/lipoatrophy are closely associated with these regimens. Therefore, there is a need for a drug with comparable effectiveness to the ritonavir boosted PIs without the side effects of dyslipidemia, which has been associated with elevated cholesterol and cardiovascular disease Raltegravir is an HIV integrase inhibitor in phase III clinical development. To date there are no approved drugs that target the same stage of the HIV-1 lifecycle. However, data from studies indicate that raltegravir is generally safe and well tolerated and has strong antiretroviral activity when used in combination with licensed antiretroviral medications. This study aims to demonstrate that patients substituting raltegravir for a PI or NNRTI based antiretroviral regimen will be associated with a 10% reduction in body fat over 24 weeks.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - DYNAMIC; BRIEF: In this study, non-operable esophagogastric adenocarcinoma cancer patients or non-operable biliary cancer patients whose cancer progressed/spread/got worse after first line treatment will be treated with or without immunotherapy and chemotherapy. This study will take place in several countries across Europe. One hundred twenty-three (123) patients will be invited to participate in this study Biliary tract cancer (BTC), is a form of cancer that start in your bile ducts, a series of tubes that runs from the liver to the small intestines. It is not know yet the exact cause of BTC. For patients who have advanced or metastatic BTC (where surgery is not possible), chemotherapy is the first option for treatment. Chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine (CisGem) is the current standard of care. Esophagogastric cancer (EGC) is cancer that occurs in the esophagus, a long hollow tube that runs from your throat to your stomach. The accumulating abnormal cells form a tumor in the esophagus that can grow to invade nearby structures and spread to other parts of the body. It's thought that chronic irritation of your esophagus may contribute to the changes that cause esophageal cancer. The purpose of this study is to look at the risks and benefits of combining DKN-01 and atezolizumab (humanized monoclonal antibody) with or without paclitaxel (chemotherapy). Immune therapy boosts the body's natural defenses to fight cancer. It uses specific products made either by participants' body or in a laboratory to improve, target or restore immune system function and control or stop cancer. Atezolizumab is such an ""immunotherapy"" drug. DKN-01 is another new type of drug (humanized monoclonal antibody) in development as anticancer agent. Paclitaxel is a commonly-used chemotherapy drug of the class of taxanes used to treat a number of cancer types, it stimulates the cell to die or to stop the cell from dividing into two new cells.The idea behind combining these drugs is linked to targeting the immune system to attack the tumor. Combining immune and chemotherapy has already demonstrated clinical activity in relapsed (return of the disease)/refractory (not responding to treatment) esophagogastric cancer patients. ; DRUG USED: DKN-01; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Esophageal Cancer; TARGET: Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) ; THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - EORTC; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Histologically proven diagnosis of metastatic or locally unresectable adenocarcinoma of the biliary tract or esophagogastric adenocarcinoma. - Measurable disease by CT/MRI (RECIST 1.1) within 28 days of randomization/enrollment - Male and female subjects of age ≥18 years - Performance status ECOG 0-1 - Life expectancy ≥ 4 months - Normal 12-lead ECG (patients with abnormal ECG will be eligible if changes are not considered clinically significant by the local investigator) - Adequate hematological function - Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dl (prior transfusions are allowed if they have been done ≥ 7 days before testing the Hb) - White blood cell (WBC) ≥ 3.0 x 109/L - Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L - Platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/L - Adequate liver function: screening labs should be performed within 7 days prior to randomization/enrollment: - Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), except subjects with Gilbert Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin level of < 3.0 x ULN. - ALT, AST & alkaline phosphatase ≤ 3 x ULN; ≤ 5 x ULN in case of liver/bone metastases - Serum albumin ≥ 2.5 g/dL - Adequate renal function: o Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) according to MDRD should be > 50 ml/min - Adequate coagulation: o International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT): ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants - The following local treatment modalities are allowed within the rules described (provided there has been a full recovery): - Surgery: patients may have undergone a non-curative operation (i.e. R2 resection [with macroscopic residual disease] or palliative bypass surgery only), performed at least 28 days before randomization/enrollment.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - REP 301; BRIEF: REP 2139-Ca is nucleic acid polymer. Nucleic acid polymers have been previously shown to clear serum hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) both preclinically (in duck HBV infected ducks) and in human patients and to act synergistically with immunotherapeutic agents such as pegylated interferon-alpha 2a or thymosin alpha-1 to restore host immunological control of HBV infection. HBsAg is an essential component of the hepatitis D virus (HDV), therefore the direct action of REP 2139-Ca in removing serum HBsAg and its synergistic effect with pegylated interferon-alpha 2a is expected to have a significant antiviral effect against HDV infection. This study will examine the safety and efficacy of REP 2139-Ca therapy when used in combination with pegylated interferon alpha-2a in patients with HBV / HDV co-infection.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - Glut1C7 (University of British Columbia); BRIEF: Glucose transporter deficiency syndrome (Glut1-DS) is a form of pediatric epilepsy caused by a genetic mutation that disrupts the body's ability to process food from the child's diet into sugar (energy) needed to support brain function. Children with Glut1-DS experience seizures that are not controlled by anticonvulsant medications, as well as delays in cognitive and motor development. Currently, Glut1-DS is treated with the ketogenic diet, a high-fat, low-sugar diet that provides the brain with an alternate source of energy. Despite the significant improvement of seizures upon this diet, seizure control is incomplete in a majority of children, and they continue to experience problems with brain development. Our team of researchers and clinicians with expertise in metabolic diseases, neurology, pediatrics, biochemistry, and genetics believes that there is an opportunity to achieve CURE's goal of ""No Seizures/No Side Effects"" for children with Glut1-DS by investigating the use of a new treatment option that is designed to compensate for the underlying biochemical deficiency thought to contribute both to the seizures and to the impaired brain development associated with Glut1-DS. The proposed treatment involves incorporating a special type of oil, called triheptanoin, into the ketogenic diet as a way to make up for a specific biochemical deficit affecting kids with Glut1-DS that the standard ketogenic diet fails to address. Our goal is to do a pilot study to test the safety and effectiveness of this promising new treatment option in a small group of children with Glut1-DS. ; DRUG USED: Dojolvi; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Metabolic - General; TARGET: Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) Cycle/Citric Acid Cycle (CAC); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: University of British Columbia; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Confirmed diagnosis of Glut1-DS with mutation(s) in SLC2A1 gene. - Male or female age 1-18 years. - Glut1-DS is currently managed with ketogenic diet for a minimum of 4 months prior to baseline visit and patient is willing to maintain this diet for the study duration.. - Inadequate response to ketogenic diet defined by clinical 'breakthrough seizures', confirmed by EEG and at least 1 clinical seizure episode documented in the seizure logbook during the baseline period. - For participants taking anticonvulsants for their seizures, anti-seizure medication should not be changed at least 4 weeks prior to starting triheptanoin treatment and the participant is willing to maintain the same dosing of all medication(s) during study participation. - Willing and able to provide written informed consent by parent(s) or guardian(s) or assent by the participant, depending on the age, after the nature of the study has been explained, and prior to any research related-procedures.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - Monotherapy; BRIEF: Background: - Glioblastoma is an aggressive type of brain cancer that often resists treatment. TRC105 is an experimental drug that blocks the growth of new blood vessels. It is being studied for possible use in treating different kinds of cancer. Researchers want to see if TRC105 can be used to treat glioblastoma that has not responded to standard treatments. Objectives: - To test the safety and effectiveness of TRC105 in adults who have glioblastoma that has not responded to standard treatments. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have glioblastoma that has not responded to standard treatments. Design: - Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected. Imaging studies and other tests will be used to study the tumor before the start of treatment. - Participants will have 28-day (4-week) cycles of treatment. - Participants will have TRC105 intravenously once a week. The first infusion will take about 4 hours. The length of time needed for the infusion may be slowly reduced if it is well tolerated. - At the end of the first cycle (the first 4 weeks), the imaging studies will be repeated before continuing TRC105. - Participants will take TRC105 for as long as the tumor does not grow and the side effects are not too severe. They will have imaging studies at the end of every cycle to evaluate the tumor. ; DRUG USED: TRC105; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Brain Cancer (Malignant Glioma; AA and glioblastoma (GBM)); TARGET: Endoglin / Cluster of Differentiation 105 (CD 105); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: National Cancer Institute (NCI); CRITERIA: - INCLUSION CRITERIA - Patients must have histologically confirmed glioblastoma or gliosarcoma. - Patients must have evidence for tumor progression by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan. This scan should be performed within 14 days prior to registration and on a fixed dose of steroids for at least 5 days.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I/II - w/Sorafenib (11-C-0102); BRIEF: Background: Sorafenib is a drug that has been approved to treat kidney and liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC) and has been shown to prolong survival in patients with HCC. It works by slowing the spread of cancer cells, but it does not fully prevent the cancer from growing again. Researchers are interested in combining sorafenib with the experimental drug TRC105, which has been designed to block the growth of blood vessels that lead to tumor growth, in order to determine whether this drug combination stops tumor growth and reduces tumor size better than sorafenib alone. Objectives: To determine the safety and effectiveness of the combination of sorafenib and TRC105 as a treatment for hepatocellular cancer that has not responded to other treatments. Eligibility: Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with hepatocellular cancer that has not responded to other treatments, and who are not considered to be candidates for liver transplantation. Patients cannot be receiving anticoagulant therapy with the exception of low dose aspirin. No history of bleeding problems or peptic ulcer disease. Design: Participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, and tumor imaging studies. Participants will have a tumor biopsy or provide previously collected tumor tissue for study. An examination of the esophagus to look for problems with blood vessels will be completed in patients with a history of cirrhosis. Participants will receive sorafenib tablets twice every day, in the morning and at night, with a full glass of water. Participants will receive TRC 105 infusions once every two weeks on days 1 and 15 of a 28 day cycle. At each visit during the first cycle, participants will have a physical examination and blood tests. Participants will continue to have blood tests and a urine test every cycle to monitor the effects of treatment, including tests of kidney function. Participants will have imaging studies after every two cycles to evaluate the results of treatment, and may also provide tumor samples for study. Treatment will continue as long as the tumor does not grow and side effects remain tolerable. ; DRUG USED: TRC105; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Hepatocellular (Liver) Cancer (HCC) (Including Secondary Metastases); TARGET: Endoglin / Cluster of Differentiation 105 (CD 105); THERAPY: Monotherapy and Combo Therapy; LEAD SPONSOR: National Cancer Institute (NCI); CRITERIA: - INCLUSION CRITERIA: - Patients must have histopathological confirmation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by the Laboratory of Pathology of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) prior to entering this study.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - w/Docetaxel; BRIEF: This study will test whether giving a combination of a vaccine together with docetaxel is more effective against breast cancer than docetaxel alone. The Food and Drug Administration has approved docetaxel to treat many cancers, including breast cancer. The vaccine consists of three parts: 1) a ""priming vaccine"" called PANVAC (PAN (all) VAC (vaccine)) trademark [TM]-V, which is made from vaccinia virus; 2) a ""boosting vaccine"" called PANVAC[TM]-F, made from fowlpox virus; and 3) sargramostim, or granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a protein that may help boost the immune system. Human genes are inserted into the vaccinia and fowlpox viruses to cause production of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and mucin 1 (MUC-1)-two proteins that are often produced by cancer cells and can be used as a target for the immune system to attack the cancer. Another type of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is inserted to cause production of other proteins that enhance immune activity. Patients 18 years of age or older with metastatic breast cancer (disease that has spread beyond the original site) and whose cancer produces CEA or mucin 1 (MUC-1) protein may be eligible for this study. Patients must have antigen type human leukocyte antigen A2 (HLA-A2). They may have received adjuvant docetaxel treatment at least 3 months before entering this study, prior hormonal therapy and up to three chemotherapy regimens. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram, and computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging scans. Participants are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups - docetaxel alone or docetaxel plus vaccine - as follows: Docetaxel Alone All patients receive docetaxel. The drug is infused through a vein over 30 to 60 minutes once a week for 3 consecutive weeks with 1 week off drug. Patients also take dexamethasone 12 hours and 1 hour before and 12 hours after the docetaxel to help prevent fluid retention (edema) that docetaxel may cause. Docetaxel Plus Vaccine Participants receive the priming vaccination followed by monthly boosting vaccinations, along with the weekly docetaxel therapy. With every vaccination, patients also receive an injection of sargramostim to increase the number of immune cells at the vaccination site. Sargramostim injections are given the day of vaccination and daily for the next 3 days. All vaccine and sargramostim doses are given as injections under the skin, usually in the thigh. Patients are observed in the clinic for 1 hour after each injection. Patients have blood tests every four weeks to monitor drug side effects and before every vaccination to check blood counts. A bone scan or CT scan (or both) is done every 2 to 3 months to check the response to treatment. Patients may continue receiving treatment as long as their disease does not worsen and they can tolerate the treatment without significant side effects. Patients assigned to receive docetaxel alone whose disease progresses after 3 months on the drug may choose to receive the vaccine or come off the study to receive other treatment options. Patients are monitored with yearly telephone calls for up to 15 years. ; DRUG USED: CV-301; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Breast Cancer; TARGET: Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), Immune System, Mucin 1 (MUC-1); THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: National Cancer Institute (NCI); CRITERIA: - INCLUSION CRITERIA: - Metastatic Breast Cancer (either male or female) with evidence of metastatic disease (must have radiographic evidence of measurable disease) on computed tomography (CT) scan or X-ray, or evidence of evaluable disease on bone scan that is consistent with metastasis and a life expectancy of at least 4 months. Patients may have received unlimited prior hormonal therapy and chemotherapy. - Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast cancer confirmed in the Pathology Clinical Center at National Cancer Institute (NCI), (or National Naval Medical Center (NNMC)) or MD Anderson Pathology Department prior to starting this study.

We have vaccinated over 700 cancer patients and have reported no cases of either self inoculation or person to person transmission of the virus. - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 - 1. - Serum creatinine less than 1.5 times upper limits of normal (ULN) OR creatinine clearance on a 24 hour urine collection of greater than or equal to 60 mL/min, standard liver function tests (LFT) limitations for patients receiving docetaxel therapy include bilirubin within ULN and serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) less than 1.5 times the ULN. If transaminases are greater than 1.5 times the ULN up to 2 times the ULN (as currently indicated), then alk phos should be less than 2.5 times the ULN. (Patients with renal abnormalities should be evaluated for creatinine clearance (CrCl) and interstitial abnormalities. A Cr Cl of greater than or equal to 60ml/min measured or calculated and proteinuria less than 1000mg per 24 hours are eligible unless explained by non-renal causes.) - Recovered completely from any grade 3 or 4 reversible hematologic and non hematologic toxicity associated with recent therapy. Typically this is 3-4 weeks for patients who most recently received cytotoxic therapy. Patients previously treated with mitomycin c or carboplatin will require a minimum of 6 weeks. - Hematological eligibility parameters (within 16 days of starting therapy): 1. Granulocyte count greater than or equal to1,500/mm^3 2. Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm^3 3. Hemoglobin (Hgb) greater than or equal to 8 Gm/dL - Must agree to use effective birth control or abstinence during and for a period of 4 months after the last vaccination therapy. - Patients whose tumors are estrogen receptor (ER) positive should have failed primary hormone therapy unless clinically indicated, i.e. in patients with visceral disease or symptomatic bone disease where up front chemotherapy is warranted. Patients who progressed or recurred following Trastuzumab (Herceptin) therapy if a patient is fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) positive or immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her-2 neu). Those patients who have progressed on trastuzumab may continue to receive the drug by their referring physician. However, if trastuzumab has been discontinued at the time of enrolling on study, it cannot be resumed while a patient remains on study. - Patients randomized to docetaxel alone (arm B) may at time of progression go on to receive vaccine alone if their ECOG performance status remains 0-1, and they do not have any uncontrolled pain or organ dysfunction that would require another intervention such as radiation or chemotherapy. Furthermore, patients initially randomized to arm B that would like to cross over and continue vaccine therapy must meet on-study eligibility and exclusion criteria with the exception of liver transaminase requirement. Patients with liver transaminase levels within Grade 1 by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 (up to 3 x ULN) will be allowed to crossover to vaccine. - Patients should appear clinically stable (in the opinion of the principle investigator) to complete the full 3 month course of vaccination with an anticipated survival of 6 months or longer. - No other active malignancies within the past 12 months (with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancers or carcinoma in situ of the bladder) or life threatening illnesses. - Patients with cardiovascular symptoms should be fully evaluated for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular disease and other standard evaluations including electrocardiogram (EKG), chest X-ray, cardiac enzymes, and echocardiogram as clinically indicated. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: - Patients should have no evidence of being immunocompromised as listed below. 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - w/ Aldesleukin; BRIEF: Background: - Aldesleukin (IL-2) is a drug that can help to shrink tumors in some patients with metastatic renal cancer and metastatic melanoma. It is possible that removing certain white blood cells (known as CD4 cells) before IL-2 treatment may improve the treatment effects. - Zanolimumab is an antibody that works by destroying CD4 cells in the blood. Researchers are interested in determining whether zanolimumab can improve the results of IL-2 treatment if it is given before, during, and after IL-2 treatment. In addition, further research with zanolimumab may provide more information on how IL-2 treatment causes tumors to stop growing or shrink. Objectives: - To evaluate the effectiveness of IL-2 treatment in conjunction with zanolimumab in individuals with metastatic cancer. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with metastatic melanoma or metastatic kidney cancer. Design: - Eligible participants will be screened with a full physical examination and medical history, imaging studies, and blood samples, including leukapheresis, to remove a sample of white blood cells for testing purposes. Participants may also have a colonoscopy and biopsies if they have received previous treatments that have been known to cause colon damage. - Participants will be treated with zanolimumab and IL-2 treatment for 9 weeks. - Zanolimumab will be given on an outpatient basis during weeks 1 through 4, 6, 8, and 9. In weeks 5 and 7, participants will receive zanolimumab as an inpatient in addition to IL-2 therapy. - Inpatient IL-2 treatment will be given during weeks 5 and 7. Up to 15 doses of IL-2 treatment will be given over a maximum of 5 days, followed by inpatient recovery time. - During week 5, participants will have tumor imaging studies prior to receiving zanolimumab and IL-2 treatment. - About 2 weeks after the treatment period, participants will return to the clinical center for a 2-day evaluation with a physical examination, imaging studies, and blood samples. - Participants whose tumors have responded to treatment will be offered up to two additional courses of treatment, starting 6 to 8 weeks after the last IL-2 dose. Subsequent courses will be given exactly as described above in the initial course of treatment.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - NINDS; BRIEF: This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of alemtuzumab (Campath® (Registered Trademark)) for improving muscle strength in patients with sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM). The most common inflammatory muscle disease in people over the age of 50, s-IBM progresses steadily, leading to severe weakness and wasting of the muscles in the arms and legs. The cause of s-IBM is not known, but it may be an autoimmune disease, in which the body's immune cells (white blood cells) attack and destroy parts of muscle. Alemtuzumab is a laboratory-made antibody currently approved to treat certain leukemias. It has also been used to treat patients with autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, multiple sclerosis, and tissue rejection associated with transplantation. Alemtuzumab destroys white blood cells that have a protein called CD52 on their surface and that might be among the cells attacking muscle. Patients with s-IBM are eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with physical and neurological examinations, blood tests, and an electrocardiogram. Participants undergo the following tests and procedures: - Campath administration: Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 1 to 1-1/2 weeks for intravenous infusions of Campath, given every other day for a total of 4 infusions. - Follow-up visits after infusions: Patients are monitored for up to 1 year with periodic blood tests, physical and neurological examinations, medical history, muscle strength measurements, and a review of symptoms, including the ability to perform daily living activities. - Lymphapheresis: Patients undergo this procedure for collecting large numbers of white blood cells twice - once at the beginning of the study and again after 6 months. Blood is removed through a needle in an arm vein and flows through a machine that separates it into its components by centrifugation (spinning). The white cells and plasma are removed and the red cells and platelets are returned to the patients through the same needle or through another needle in the other arm. - Muscle biopsy: Muscle biopsies are done in the operating room under local anesthetic. A small incision is made in the thigh or upper arm and a small piece of muscle is removed. Biopsies are done at the beginning of the study and again after 6 months. ; DRUG USED: Campath; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Sporadic Inclusion Body Myositis (sIBM); TARGET: Cluster of Differentiation 52 (CD52); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS); CRITERIA: - Only patients who are currently enrolled in protocol 02-N-0121 Study of Immune Dysregulation in Patients with Sporadic Inclusion Body Myositis (s-IBM) will be considered for enrollment in protocol 04-N-0133.
