RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab and bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Cetuximab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving monoclonal antibodies together with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective with cetuximab and/or bevacizumab in treating patients with colorectal cancer. ; DRUG USED: Erbitux; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Colorectal Cancer (CRC); TARGET: EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor); THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology; CRITERIA: 1. Locally Advanced or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer 1. Eligible patients must have histologically or cytologically documented adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum. Patients must have either locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic disease. Patients with resected primary tumors who have documented metastases are eligible. Documentation of residual disease by CT scan or surgeon's notes is required for all patients, and histologic confirmation of metastases is strongly encouraged. 2. Patients with a history of colorectal cancer treatment by surgical resection who develop radiological or clinical evidence of metastatic cancer do not require separate histological or cytological confirmation of metastatic disease unless: - Either an interval of greater than five years has elapsed between the primary surgery and the development of metastatic disease or - The primary cancer was stage I. Clinicians should consider biopsy of lesions to establish the diagnosis of metastatic colorectal cancer in each case if there is substantial clinical ambiguity regarding the nature or source of apparent metastases. 3. At the time of randomization, the intent of this treatment must be indicated palliative or neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the potential for resection of all sites of metastatic disease. 2. Only patients with a wildtype K-ras gene as determined by the laboratory at the SWOG Solid Tumor Repository or by a local CLIA-certified laboratory are eligible. Patients with a mutation in the K-ras gene are ineligible. All patients must have available for analysis of K-ras status at least one H and E slide and one paraffin block of the previously resected primary colorectal tumor and/or a tumor deposit. For patients registered and randomized based on local CLIA-certified laboratory results, SWOG analysis will be confirmatory only. 3. Prior Treatment 1. No prior systemic treatment for advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer is allowed. Prior regional chemotherapy (eg, hepatic arterial infusion) is also not allowed. - Patients may have received prior adjuvant chemotherapy that included fluorouracil alone or in combination with fluorouracil and oxaliplatin or irinotecan (no more than 6 months); or radiation with radiosensitizing chemotherapy. - The last course of adjuvant chemotherapy must have concluded > 12 months prior to colorectal cancer recurrence. - Patients may have received neoadjuvant chemo-radiation with capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil. - Patients may not have received itraconazole or ketoconazole less than 4 weeks prior to randomization. - No prior exposure to any tyrosine kinase inhibitors or other agents (including protein products, monoclonal antibodies, antisense, etc.) that target VEGF or EGF receptors is allowed. - No prior treatment with bevacizumab or cetuximab. 2. Patients may not have had prior radiotherapy to greater than 25% of bone marrow. (Standard adjuvant rectal cancer chemoradiation will not exclude patient from protocol entry.) Radiation must have concluded \u2265 4 weeks prior to randomization. 3. Patients should have completed any major surgery \u2265 4 weeks from randomization. Patients must have completed any minor surgery \u2265 2 weeks prior to randomization. Patients must have fully recovered from the procedure. (Insertion of a vascular access device is not considered major or minor surgery.) 4. No previous or concurrent malignancy is allowed except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the patient has been disease-free for five years. 5. For patients who are to receive FOLFIRI: No evidence of Gilbert's Syndrome or of homozygosity for the UGT1A1*28 allele. 1. Patients with Gilbert's Syndrome may have a greater risk of irinotecan toxicity due to the abnormal glucuronidation of SN-38. Evidence of Gilbert's Syndrome would include a prior finding of an isolated elevation of indirect bilirubin. 2. UGT1A1 genotyping is not required on this study. However, patients known to be homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele are not to receive FOLFIRI for this study. Patients with Gilbert's Syndrome or who are found to be homozygous for the UGT1A1 allele who will receive FOLFOX are eligible. 6. No sensory peripheral neuropathy of \u2265 grade 2 at baseline for patients who are to receive FOLFOX. 7. No known central nervous system metastases or carcinomatous meningitis. 8.

The patient has no active bleeding or pathological condition that carries a high risk of bleeding (eg, tumor involving major vessels or known varices). 15. Patients receiving anti-platelet agents are eligible. In addition, patients who are on daily prophylactic aspirin or anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation are eligible. 16. No significant history of bleeding events or GI perforation: 1. Patients with a history of significant bleeding episodes (eg, hemoptysis, upper or lower GI bleeding ) within 6 months of randomization are not eligible unless the source of bleeding has been resected. 2. Patients with a history of GI perforation within 12 months of randomization are not eligible. 17. No arterial thrombotic events within 6 months before randomization, including transient ischemic attack (TIA), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), unstable angina or angina requiring surgical or medical intervention in the past 6 months, or myocardial infarction (MI).

This two-arm study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy for insulin independence by utilizing the FDA-approved oral immune tolerance agent, Cyclosporine A, and the FDA-approved proton-pump inhibitor, Lansoprazole. Lansoprazole and other proton-pump inhibitors increase gastrin levels. Gastrin was initially shown to have the potential to increase new beta cell formation in 1955 (Zollinger RM and Ellison EH. Ann Surg. 1955;142(4):709-23). Studies with the immune tolerance agent, Cyclosporine A, previously demonstrated that among recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients, insulin independence was achieved in as many as 67.5% of patients within 7 weeks of therapy (Bougneres PF et al. N Engl J Med. 1988:17;318(11):663-70). Cyclosporine A protected the remaining beta cells from further autoimmune attack, but over time, there was limited beta cell regeneration, and insulin was ultimately required by all patients. Therefore, this study proposes the usage of Cyclosporine A with a beta regeneration agent. Follow-up studies for up to 13 years among 285 type 1 patients utilizing Cyclosporine A for 20 months, did not demonstrate renal or other side effects (Assan R. et al. Diabetes Metab Res Rev. 2002;18(6):464-72). Human clinical trials with gastrin and epidermal growth factor demonstrated reductions in daily insulin requirements by much as 75% within 3 months following four weeks of therapy among existing type 1 diabetes patients (Transition Therapeutics, March 5, 2007 http://www.transitiontherapeutics.com/media/archive.php Accessed January 1, 2013). Lack of the ability to sustain these results was likely due to the ongoing autoimmune attack on the new beta cells generated by therapy. Gastrin alone has been shown to induce beta cell neogenesis from human pancreatic ductal tissue without epidermal growth factor in in vitro studies (Suarez-Pinzon WL et al. JCEM. 2005;90(6):3401-3409). Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. Despite evidence that many different immune tolerance agents have successfully reversed diabetes in rodent type 1 models, none have been successful in sustaining insulin independence in man (Ablamunits V et al. Ann NY Acad Sci. 2007;1103:19-32). The distinctions and complexities of islets in man are far different than that of rodents (Levetan CS and Pierce SM. Endocr Pract. 2012 Nov 27:1-36 Epub ahead of print). We hypothesize that in man, both an immune tolerance agent and a beta regeneration agent are required to sustain insulin independence. Based upon proton-pump inhibitors having been shown to increase plasma gastrin levels up to 10-fold, this clinical trial utilizes the oral proton-pump inhibitor, Lansoprazole. This study will determine the safety and efficacy of Cyclosporine A used with and without Lansoprazole to determine the impact on insulin independence among patients with existing type 1 diabetes. Cyclosporine A is utilized to protect the new beta cells formed by Lansoprazole. The combination of the two therapies may render reductions in insulin requirements and have a greater impact on sustained insulin independence than previously reported with Cyclosporine A or gastrin alone among type 1 patients.A This 52-week study consists of two treatment arms designed to assess the safety and efficacy of achieving insulin independence using: - Oral Lansoprazole/Oral Cyclosporine A - Oral Placebo/Oral Placebo It is hypothesized that the combination of oral Cyclosporine A and oral Lansoprazole will safely render significantly more patients with existing type 1 diabetes, insulin independent and may serve as a novel and innovative treatment approach for patients with type 1 diabetes utilizing two FDA-approved therapies. ; DRUG USED: PRL001; DRUG CLASS: Non-NME; INDICATION: Diabetes Mellitus, Type I; TARGET: Calcineurin phosphatase , Proton pump; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Perle Bioscience, Inc.; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: 1.

The \"thickening\" of the blood in relation with a modified function of the cells has several consequences like increased blood pressure, pruritus of the skin, fatigue, disturbed blood circulation in the brain as well as fingers and toes and an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis (thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot in a vessel); like stroke, cardiac infarction, deep vein thrombosis in the legs. In case of a strong increase of platelets there is an additional risk of bleedings. As the disease progresses the size of spleen and liver increased in most cases and the bone marrow shows signs of fibrosis.

Toca 511 is a live virus that has been built to carry a gene into tumor cells. This gene carries instructions that cause the tumor cells to turn Toca FC, typically used to treat fungal infections, into a drug that may kill the tumor cells.

Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether giving carboplatin and paclitaxel together with bevacizumab is more effective than carboplatin and paclitaxel alone in treating patients with ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cavity cancer.

Overactive Bladder syndrome (OAB) is defined as symptoms of urgency and frequency with urge urinary incontinence (OAB-wet) and without urge incontinence (OAB-dry). Conservative first line treatments for urge incontinence combined with other OAB symptoms (OAB-wet) include behavioral therapy, pelvic floor training +/- biofeedback, or the use of anticholinergic medications. These treatment modalities may not result in total continence and often drug therapy is discontinued because of lack of efficacy, side effects and cost or because of not wanting to take a pill. Behavioral therapy and pelvic muscle exercises require consistent, active intervention by the patient which is often not sustained. Thus, the objective of the Anticholinergic vs Botox Comparison Study (ABC) is to determine whether a single intra-detrusor injection of botulinum toxin A (Botox A\u00ae) is more effective than a standardized regimen of oral anticholinergics in reducing urge urinary incontinence.

This two-arm study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy for insulin independence of two FDA and EMA-approved therapies among recent onset type 1 diabetes patients. One of the greatest new insights of today in the field of type 1 diabetes, is the understanding that in man, unlike the success seen in type 1 diabetes mouse models, there is no beta cell regeneration with immune therapy alone. In man, type 1 diabetes is now considered to be a disease of both autoimmunity and lack of beta cell regeneration (Levetan 2103). More than 500 patients with new onset type 1 diabetes have been given cyclosporine and some studies have demonstrated as high as a 57% insulin-free remission rate that was not sustained due to the lack of beta cell regeneration (Feutren 1986, Bougneres 1988, Eisenbarth 1989, Sobel 2010). Studies among diabetes patients with proton pump inhibitors have shown the potential to increase beta cell mass by 40%, but among type 1 patients without immune protection, such outcomes cannot be not achieved (Singh 2012, Griffin 2014). The usage of a beta cell regeneration agent such as omeprazole, in combination with an immune tolerance, like cyclosporine, provides both the potential ability to maintain and regenerate beta cells. This is a new paradigm for the treatment of new onset type 1 diabetes. More than 60 human trials have been conducted among type 1 diabetes with a variety of different therapies aimed at preventing autoimmune attack on insulin-producing beta cells. None have been as effective as cyclosporine in both slowing the decline in beta cell mass and resulting in the potential for insulin-free remissions. (Canadian-European Randomized Control Trial 1988, Eisenbarth 1989, Skyler 1992, Sobel 2010). Because cyclosporine is known for its potential side-effects, most notably in the kidney, all previous studies among type 1 patients have carefully monitored kidney function. Follow-up studies for up to 13 years among 285 type 1 patients utilizing cyclosporine for 20 months did not demonstrate renal or other side effects at the dosages that will be used in this trial (Assan 2002). The most effective initiating dosage for insulin independence in the cyclosporine trials was 7.5 mg/kg/day, but for safety, this study will begin at a lower dosage of 5 mg/kg/day and will monitor kidney function and cyclosporine levels initially on a weekly basis. This study will use only those dosages of cyclosporine that have not demonstrated toxicity to the kidney or resulted in non-reversible side effects among more than 500 patients with recent onset type 1 diabetes treated with cyclosporine. Omeprazole has been shown to significantly increase gastrin levels which is associated with increased beta cells. Lansoprazole has also been shown to be safe among patients with new onset type 1 diabetes for one year with a trend toward increased beta cell mass among patients with higher gastrin levels. In a randomized trial for 12 weeks among 56 patients undergoing pancreatectomy, those randomized to receive a proton pump inhibitor had significantly increased gastrin levels, higher insulin levels and improved endocrine function by glucose tolerance testing and less pancreatic atrophy as measured by CT scans (Jang 2003). The recently completed REPAIR T1D trial among newly diagnosed type 1 patients used a proton pump inhibitor and GLP-1 therapies for 1 year for beta regeneration failed to meet its endpoint of increased stimulated C-peptide. Lack of maintenance or regeneration of beta cells was specifically noted to have likely been due to lack of usage of immune therapy to protect beta cells (Griffin 2014, Rigby 2014). Those patients in REPAIR T1D, who did achieve gastrin and GLP-1 levels above those in the control group had a trend towards improved preservation of C-peptide with a suggestion of a decreased rate of fall of C-peptide through 12 months (Griffin 2014 Appendix Supplemental data). Glucose levels also trended lower than controls in the intervention arm with gastrin levels above the control arm (Griffin 2014 Appendix Supplemental data). In humans, the newly forming beta cells are under the greatest immune attack among type 1 patients (Meier 2006). REPAIR T1D underscores the importance for both immune therapy with a regeneration therapy among type 1 patients (Griffin 2014, Rigby 2014). The combination of cyclosporine with a proton pump inhibitor has the potential to demonstrate maintenance and expansion of residual beta cells. This combination therapy provides the unique ability for patients to become insulin independent.

Subjects will undertake a 1-week screening period to provide baseline data and for assessment of eligibility. At the Baseline visit (Week 0), eligible subjects (having an average Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score of >4 for worst pain associated with or following defaecation) will be randomised on a 1:1:1 basis to one of the three treatment groups. Subjects will receive diltiazem hydrochloride 2% cream or diltiazem hydrochloride 4% cream or placebo cream. Study treatment will be applied in and around the anus, three times daily, for up to 8 weeks. Following the Week 0 Visit, subjects will be contacted by telephone during Week 1 to ensure adequate compliance with study treatment, to ensure that study drug is being tolerated and that any concomitant medications are used at a level consistent with that prior to randomisation. Subjects will return to the clinic for safety and efficacy assessments at Weeks 2, 4, and 8 and receive a follow-up telephone call at Week 12, following cessation of therapy. Concomitant laxatives and stool softeners will be permitted, as needed, during the entire study period (screening and treatment) to ensure that constipation or passage of hard stools does not confound evaluation or improvement of the condition. Fibre supplements will be allowed but should be continued at the baseline level. Instructions on the use of the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) diary will be issued to subjects to record fissure-related pain (NRS) and bowel symptoms daily during the 1-week screening period, to confirm eligibility and post-randomisation to record worst anal pain associated with or following defaecation (NRS) and daily overall AF-related pain (NRS). A record of the number of times the subject has defaecated, laxative and analgesic usage will also be made as well as the number of applications of study treatment, any changes to concurrent medications and any Adverse Events (AEs). In addition, at some or all study visits, subjects will record the Patient's Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) on a 7 point Likert scale, complete a Short Form 36 (SF-36) quality of life questionnaire and will undergo examination of their AF. Routine blood samples will be taken and the Skin Irritation Score (SIS) recorded for safety evaluations. Subjects may receive permitted medications for pain per Entry Criteria, but these should remain stable, where possible, up to the Week 8 Visit. Introduction of any new medication for AF will not be permitted unless the Investigator deems \"rescue\" intervention necessary. A subject will be deemed a treatment failure if rescue intervention is required and will have to be withdrawn from the study. Any subject leaving the study following randomisation for any reason will be asked to complete the Early Withdrawal Visit. This includes subjects who withdraw due to the development of AEs or intolerance, as well as subjects who require rescue intervention. These subjects will return for safety follow-up visits at their previously scheduled follow-up assessment appointments. If complete healing has occurred at the 2 or 4 Week visits, (i.e. prior to the end of the 8-week treatment period), subjects will be asked to continue applying the medication for the full 8 week course, up to the final assessment. Following the Week 8 visit (or Early Withdrawal Visit), subjects will be followed up for a further 4 weeks (following cessation of study medication) to note any AEs. All routine blood analyses (haematology and biochemistry) and plasma levels of diltiazem and of its principal metabolites will be analysed by central laboratories. ; DRUG USED: Dolizem; DRUG CLASS: Non-NME; INDICATION: Chronic Pain; TARGET: Calcium Channel; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: S.L.A.
