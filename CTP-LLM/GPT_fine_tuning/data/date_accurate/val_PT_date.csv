This clinical trial will be the first evaluation of ONC201 in humans and will enroll patients with advanced cancer. This trial includes a phase I portion that will evaluate the safety of ONC201 and the recommended dose for the phase II portion. The phase II portion will evaluate the initial efficacy profile of ONC201 in select types of cancer. ; DRUG USED: ONC201; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Solid Tumors; TARGET: Dopamine 2 (D2) Receptor; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Chimerix; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: 1. Patients must have histologically confirmed glioblastoma multiforme, triple-negative breast cancer, colorectal cancer, or non-small cell lung cancer patients with advanced disease and limited therapeutic options. 2. Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥20 mm with conventional techniques or as ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. For lymph nodes to be considered measurable, the short axis must be ≥15 mm when assessed by CT scan. All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non-measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered non-measurable. See Section 11 for the evaluation of measurable disease. 3. Patients are eligible for enrollment if they have not had prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, anticancer therapy, or investigational agent within 28 days prior to the first dose (Week 1, Day 1); 42 days weeks in the case of alkylating agents. Patients are eligible for enrollment if they have had no surgery within 6 weeks prior to the first dose. Any number of prior therapies is allowable. 4. All adverse events Grade > 1 related to prior therapies (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and/or surgery) must be resolved, except for alopecia. 5. Age ≥18 years. 6. ECOG performance status ≤ 2 (Karnofsky ≥ 60%, see Appendix A). 7. Life expectancy of greater than 10 weeks. 8.

Patients with a known HIV-positive test on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible for the initial first-in-man trial because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with ONC201. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated. 7. Patients with known history of cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, tachyarrhythmias or bradycardia will be excluded. Patients receiving therapeutic agents known to prolong QT interval will be excluded. Patients with history of CHF, or MI or stroke in the last 3 months will be excluded. Patients with a history of seizures will be excluded form the initial trial because ONC201 crosses the blood-brain barrier and this may affect their anti-seizure therapy. 8.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - PoC; BRIEF: Objectives of the phase 2 prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to assess safety and efficacy of TRO40303 administered just before balloon inflation during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for limitation of infarct size in patients treated for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The study is being conducted in 9 centres in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and France. One hundred eighty patients will be included. It will last one month per patient and its overall duration will be 11 months. The efficacy will be assessed by infarct size expressed as area under the curve for creatine kinase and troponin I (blood sampling at D1, D2 and D3), and also evaluated by Cardiac Magnetic Resonance. Safety will be assessed by - clinic evaluation, - blood samples (hematology, biochemistry, renal and hepatic function), - Recording and follow-up of major adverse events occurring during the first 48h after reperfusion (death, heart failure, AMI, stroke, recurrent ischemia, the need for repeat revascularization, renal or hepatic, vascular complication and bleeding). - ECG - Recording cardiac events during one month after AMI - Follow-up of global left ventricular function by Echocardiography at D3 and D30. Demographic and medical history at inclusion and non-cardiac events occurring during the first 30 days will be recorded. TRO40303 plasma concentration will be assessed at 15 min, 6h, and 12h post the end of administration. Sample size calculation assuming a reduction of 35% of the AUC for Troponin I release, for a statistical power of 85% and a probability of type I error of 0.05. Main analysis: between-group comparisons of AUCs for serum troponin I and CK release will be performed using O'Brien's method for multiple endpoints testing. Secondary analysis: comparisons of the CMR criteria described above will be performed using mixed model of ANCOVA. All analyses will be performed on the Full Analysis Set and Per protocol populations. Safety analysis: A comparison of the incidence of cumulative adverse clinical events between the groups will be performed by Fisher's exact tests. Subjects will undergo primary PCI and receive concomitant medications according to current standard of care. After coronary angiography is performed but just before balloon inflation is performed, patients who meet the enrollment criteria will be randomly assigned to either the control group or the TRO40303 group. Randomization is ensured by taking the treatment units in ascending and consecutive order in each strata (anterior/posterior as determined on ECG). Just before balloon inflation, ideally less than 5 minutes, and with a maximum of 15 minutes before balloon inflation and stenting, the patients in the TRO40303 group will receive an intravenous slow-bolus (35 mL/min) injection of 6 mg/kg of TRO40303 injected in peripheral IV. The patients in the control group will receive an equivalent volume of the placebo. Patients will be hospitalized for as long as there is a medical indication. CMR and echocardiography will accordingly be conducted as in/out patient between day 3 (ideally) and 5. A follow-up visit will be conducted one month after PCI. ; DRUG USED: TRO40303; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS); TARGET: Mitochondrial Translocator Protein (TSPO); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Hoffmann-La Roche; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - w/high-dose IL-2; BRIEF: The purpose of this study is to test the safety of an investigational vaccine called TroVax when given in conjunction with Interleukin-2 (IL-2) treatment. TroVax is the experimental product in this trial and its value as a medicine has not yet been proven. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is standard treatment for your cancer, which means that you could receive it even if you choose not to participate in this study. TroVax is being studied as a possible treatment for patients with cancer of the kidney. TroVax belongs to a class of medicines called a vaccine. A vaccine helps the body's immune system to recognize and kill foreign invading organisms effectively. It is believed that one of the reasons why cancer can spread through the body is that the immune system cannot recognize them as being different from normal tissues and therefore cannot kill the cancer cells. A vaccine that alerts the immune system to the presence of cancer cells in the body could lead to the immune system being able to target and kill those cancer cells effectively. This trial is of a completely new way of trying to treat cancer in the future by the use of vaccination injections. TroVax consists of a virus that has been changed so that it is no longer infectious and carries a gene for a protein called 5T4. This protein is carried by many kidney cancer calls. When the virus is injected, it makes the protein, and the body's immune system is then able to recognize this protein and kill the cells that have it (i.e. the cancer cells). The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of TroVax injections and to understand whether TroVax could make such an immune response happen in patients with renal cell cancer while receiving Interleukin-2 (IL-2). This study will also observe and monitor any side effects experienced in patients who receive TroVax while being treated with IL-2. ; DRUG USED: TroVax; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Renal Cell Cancer (RCC); TARGET: 5T4 tumor antigen , Immune System; THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: Oxford BioMedica; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Metastatic renal clear cell adenocarcinoma, histologically proven by biopsy of the primary tumour and/or a metastasis.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - GeparQuinto (Neoadjuvant); BRIEF: Anthracycline-taxane based chemotherapy regimens are recommended mainly by current guidelines for neoadjuvant application of systemic treatment. The addition of other cytotoxic agents, e.g. antimetabolites, vincaalkaloids, or platinum salts resulted in marginal increase in efficacy, but was associated also with an increase in toxicity. Recently, only the addition of the Her-2 antibody trastuzumab has significantly improved pathologic response rate. Therefore, two major strategies are followed in current research projects: - To improve the selection of patients according to their tumors' sensitivity to chemotherapy. - To implement small molecules with specific mechanism of action. Within the GeparQuinto trial, the first strategy is followed by: - The PREDICT substudy. A gene signature specific for the response to anthracyclines and taxanes will be prospectively evaluated for its ability to identify patients with chance higher than 50% for a pCR. The results may leed to a better risk-benefit ratio for the use of conventional chemotherapy. - Adapting further chemotherapy to the response of the tumor to the first couple of chemotherapy cycles. Based on the previous experience made by the GeparTrio study, patients not responding early have a low chance to respond with a pCR irrespective of the type of chemotherapy. So, if further chemotherapy is planned, therapy should be selected according to a favorable toxicity profile. The second strategy is followed by investigating in three parallel group comparisons the efficiency of three distinct small molecules which appear to be generally active in breast cancer: - Bevacizumab, an inhibitor of the VEGF pathway targeting tumor neo-angiogenesis. - Lapatinib, an inhibitor of the Her-1 and Her-2 receptor tyrosine kinase. - RAD001 (Everolimus), an inhibitor of the mTOR molecule, a central controller of tumor cell growth and angiogenesis and chemosensitizer. Treatment for patients participating in the GeparQuinto study will be allocated according to the Her-2 status of the tumor as well as according to the sonographic response after the first 4 cycles of treatment. Experimental therapy with bevacizumab, lapatinib, and everolimus (RAD001) will be randomly added in distinct settings. ; DRUG USED: Avastin; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Breast Cancer; TARGET: VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth factor); THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: German Breast Group; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - Neurofibromatosis; BRIEF: Formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) is important for tumor growth in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). It is known that tumors make a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and there are higher levels of VEGF in the tumors and blood of many patients with NF2. VEGF stimulates the formation of blood vessels that supply the tumor with nutrients and oxygen. PTC299 is an oral drug that has been shown to decrease production of VEGF in animal models of human cancer. In these animal models, oral PTC299 administration decreases VEGF levels in the tumor and in the bloodstream, decreases blood vessel numbers in the tumor, and significantly slows or halts tumor growth. Safety studies in research animals indicate good tolerability at doses and drug levels that are higher than those planned for the clinical studies. Results from Phase 1a studies in healthy volunteers indicate that PTC299 achieves levels of PTC299 in the bloodstream that are known to be active in animal models of human tumor. This Phase 2 study is designed to test the hypothesis that PTC299 will be tolerable and will show evidence of VEGF reduction, antitumor activity, and hearing improvement when administered orally to patients with NF2. ; DRUG USED: PTC299; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Neurofibromatosis (NF); TARGET: VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth factor); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: PTC Therapeutics; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Age ≥18 years - Diagnosis of NF2 - Presence of vestibular schwannomas - Evidence of progressive increase in vestibular schwannoma size or worsening hearing loss due to vestibular schwannoma - Adequate functional status (Karnofsky Performance Score ≥60) - Adequate bone marrow, liver, kidney function - If sexually active, willingness to use effective barrier or medical contraception - For women of childbearing potential, no pregnancy or breast-feeding - Discontinuation of other therapies (except corticosteroids) for the treatment of NF2 and resolution of any acute toxic effects of prior therapies - Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan, laboratory tests, other study procedures, and study restrictions - Willingness to provide informed consent Exclusion Criteria: - Uncontrolled hypertension, major bleeding, HIV infection, or recent acute cardiovascular event - Prior exposure to another anti-angiogenic therapy (eg, bevacizumab, sunitinib) ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: To assess the effects of PTC299 on tumor volume and/or word recognition in patients with NF2.; SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: To assess the effects of PTC299 on pure tone thresholds, brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAERs), and otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) in patients with NF2",No

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - Extension (Israel); BRIEF: At a previous study the investigators have assessed the safety and efficacy of treatment with AAT(Alpha 1 Antitrypsin)in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes subjects aiming at beta cells preservation . Since treatment with AAT is expected to be a chronic treatment; stopping treatment will probably result in eventual loss of the preserved beta-cell function. Indeed, other investigational drugs aiming at beta cells preservation have shown that patients who were initially treated and maintained their initial beta-cell function, required continuation of treatment or they lost the beta-cell function. Therefore, in this extension study, patients who were previously treated with AAT and maintained clinically significant beta-cell function are offered a continuation of treatment, since they are likely to benefit from use of the medication. The proposed study is aimed to assess the long term effect of AAT in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus: safety and tolerability of treatment, and effect on beta-cell function.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - ASTRID; BRIEF: GTx-024 is an orally bioavailable and tissue-selective nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) that has demonstrated androgenic and anabolic activity and is currently being evaluated as a potential treatment for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in postmenopausal women. Urinary incontinence and pelvic floor disorders are major health problems for women, especially as they age. Pelvic floor muscle relaxation has been found to correlate with lower urinary tract symptoms including SUI. Muscles of the pelvic floor and lower urinary tract are crucial for supporting the pelvic organs and micturition; however, damage to the muscles or lack of hormonal stimulation are thought to contribute to pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence. Although anabolic steroids may increase muscle mass and strength, lack of oral bioavailability and known potential risks have limited their use. Nonsteroidal SARMs have potential to achieve benefits of anabolic steroid therapy (improved muscle mass, cholesterol/triglyceride levels, glucose metabolism, and bone density) with fewer adverse effects, such as hirsutism and acne, in women. Both nonclinical and clinical data suggest that SARMs may provide a new therapeutic option for pelvic floor and lower urinary tract disorders, as both testosterone and its more potent metabolite, dihydrotestosterone, have anabolic effects on muscle. ; DRUG USED: Enobosarm; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Urinary Incontinence; TARGET: Androgen receptors; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: GTx; CRITERIA: Key Inclusion Criteria: - SUI symptoms of at least 6 months duration - Predominant SUI as determined at the Screening Visit using the Medical, Epidemiological, and Social Aspects of Aging (MESA) urinary questionnaire. - 24-Hour pad weight > 3 g during the screening period - A minimum of 1 and no more than 15 SUI episodes on any single day AND no fewer than 9 total SUI episodes over 3 days during the screening period - Positive bladder stress test conducted during the Screening Visit Key Exclusion Criteria: - History of pelvic radiation treatment - History of urethral diverticula - History of urethral sling or anterior prolapse repair - Treatment with urethral bulking agents and/or other SUI procedure or surgery within the 6 months prior to the Screening Visit - Known vesicoureteral reflux, vaginal prolapse beyond the introitus, or other significant pelvic floor abnormalities - Urinary incontinence of neurogenic etiology - Morbidly obese (defined as 100 pounds over ideal body weight, or body mass index 40 or greater) - Chronic hepatitis - Hepatic cirrhosis - Evidence of active infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C - History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection - Subjects with a history of breast or endometrial cancer ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: Number of Participants With a ≥ 50% Reduction From Baseline in the Mean Number of Stress Incontinence Episodes Per Day at Week 12; SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: ",No

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II/III - Long-Term Study; BRIEF: This extension study will provide data to further evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of three doses of BYM338 and to assess the long-term effects of BYM338 in patients with sporadic inclusion body myositis. The extension study was planned to consist of a Screening epoch (to assess patient eligibility), followed by a Treatment Period 1 epoch (double-blind and placebo-controlled), and a Treatment Period 2 epoch (open-label). A Post-treatment Follow-up (FUP) epoch was also planned for patients who discontinued prematurely. Patients who complete the core study and qualify for this extension study entered Treatment Period 1 and continued on the study drug to which they were randomized in the core study (either to one of the three bimagrumab doses (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10mg/kg) or placebo) during Treatment Period 1. Thus, Treatment Period 1 was double-blind and placebo-controlled. Participants were to continue in Treatment Period 1 until the dose with the best benefit-risk profile was determined from the core study data and selected (duration of Treatment Period 1 was estimated to be between 6 and 8 months). Once the dose with the best benefit-risk profile was selected, all participants (including those who were receiving placebo) were planned to enter Treatment Period 2 and switch to open-label treatment with bimagrumab at the selected dose. The core study has been completed but since the core study did not meet the primary end point (no bimagrumab dose was identified based on the core study efficacy results) the extension study was terminated as per protocol/sponsor's decision; therefore, no patients had entered Treatment Period 2. Instead, all patients were to return for the End of Treatment Period 1 (EOT1) visit at their next scheduled visit. As per protocol, all patients who discontinued study medication during Treatment Period 1 for any reason, including due to the study having been stopped as per protocol/sponsor's decision, were to have entered and complete the 6-month FUP after their EOT1 visit. Due to the nature of the design of the core and extension studies and termination of study medication in the extension study, the treatment duration for individual patients varied considerably.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I - CaNCaP02 (Cambridge University); BRIEF: Patients with localised prostate cancer can be treated by radical prostatectomy (prostate gland removal surgery) or radiotherapy. Around 15% of men with prostate cancer are diagnosed with high risk disease meaning they are more likely to suffer treatment failure, disease progression and mortality. To date little progress has been made towards identifying effective treatment strategies that might delay or prevent disease recurrence in this patient population. Better identification of patients at high risk of relapse and improvements in therapy are therefore research priorities. A protein named Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is known to play an important role in the development of prostate cancer. mTOR forms two protein complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) and sends signals helping cancer cells to grow while controlling their energy use. Blocking the function of mTOR, with an inhibitor such as AZD2014, might shut down the supply of energy supply to tumour cells leading to reduced cell growth and potentially slowing the progression of the disease. The purpose of this study is to investigate the molecular pharmacology of AZD2014 treatment given to patients with prostate cancer prior to radical prostatectomy. The feasibility, safety and tolerability of a short course of AZD2014 will also be assessed. ; DRUG USED: Vistusertib; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Prostate Cancer; TARGET: Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR)/mTORC; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Men aged 18 years old or older - ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 - Clinical diagnosis of Intermediate (one or more of stage T2, or PSA >10ng/mL, or Gleason score of at least 7) or High Risk Prostate Cancer (one or more of stage T2c, or PSA >20ng/mL, or Gleason score of at least 8) - Patient suitable for radical prostatectomy, following discussion at specialist MDT and subsequent review by surgical team - Willing to use barrier contraceptive method, e.g. condom & spermicide - Adequate bone marrow reserve or organ function (as specified in the study protocol) - Normal chest radiograph and oxygen saturations, OR normal CT thorax Exclusion Criteria: - Contraindication to AZD2014 (as specified in the study protocol) - Patients who have experienced any of the following procedures in the past 12 months: coronary artery bypass graft; angioplasty; vascular stent; myocardial infarction; angina pectoris; congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association grade of 2 or above); ventricular arrhythmias requiring continuous therapy; supraventricular arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, which are uncontrolled; haemorrhagic or thrombotic stroke including transient ischaemic attacks or any other CNS bleeding. - Previous chemotherapy, biological therapy, radiation therapy, androgens, thalidomide, immunotherapy, other anticancer agents and/or investigational agents within 28 days of starting study treatment. - Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to study entry (excluding placement of vascular access), or minor surgery within 2 weeks of entry into the study - Potent or moderate inhibitors and inducers of CYP2C8 if taken within the stated wash-out period: Gemfibrozil, trimethoprim, glitazones, montelukast, deferasirox and quercetin (1-week minimum wash out period) - Any haematopoietic growth factors, e.g. G-CSF, GM-CSF, within 4 weeks prior to receiving study drug - As judged by the Investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease (as specified in the study protocol) - Abnormal ECHO or MUGA at baseline - Mean resting QTc of 470msec or above (as per local reading) - Concomitant medications known to prolong QT interval, or with factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation, or risk of arrythmic events (examples specified in study protocol).

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I/II - MYD88 L265P Mutation; BRIEF: Recent reports have identified a specific oncogenic mutation L265P of the MYD88 gene in approximately 30% of the patients with the activated B-cell (ABC) type of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). MYD88 is an initial adapter linker protein in the signaling pathway of the Toll Like Receptors (TLRs), including the endosomal TLRs 7, 8, and 9, for which the ligands are nucleic acids. IMO-8400 is an oligonucleotide specifically designed to inhibit ligand activation of TLRs 7,8, and 9. Recent studies indicate that in the presence of L265P mutation ligand activation of those TLRs results in markedly increased signaling with subsequent increased cell activation, cell survival, and cell proliferation. The scientific rationale for assessing the use of IMO-8400 to treat patients with DLBCL and the L265P mutation is based on laboratory observations that IMO-8400 inhibits ligand-based activation of cells with the mutation and decreases the survival and proliferation of the cell populations responsible for the propagation of the disease. ; DRUG USED: IMO-8400; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) - NHL; TARGET: Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8), Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Patients must have a diagnosis of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) of non-GCB subtype, established according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria that has been tested for the MyD88 L265P mutation. - In addition to the above, key inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed below. 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I - SAD/MAD; BRIEF: This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, first-in-human, 3-part study in which the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of orally administered AL-704 will be assessed in healthy adult subjects and in adult subjects with CHC infection. Part 1: Healthy adult subjects will receive one of 5 single ascending oral doses (SAD) of AL-704 ranging from 100 mg to 1,500 mg (Cohorts 1 to 5). Within each cohort subjects will be randomized to receive either AL-704 or placebo (n=8 per cohort; 6 assigned to AL-704 and 2 assigned to placebo), in a fasted state. The planned dose-escalation scheme may be changed based on the emerging PK and safety data. Two additional cohorts (Cohorts 6 and 7) may be enrolled for evaluation of additional doses at the discretion of the Sponsor and Investigator, based on the emerging pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, and the presence of an acceptable safety profile. Part 2: To assess the food effect on pharmacokinetics, 8 healthy subjects from one full Part 1 cohort who received a single dose of AL-704 or placebo in a fasted state, will receive the same single dose of AL-704 or placebo in a fed state in Part 2 after a washout period of 7-14 days (depending on PK results). It is expected that Cohort 3 of Part 1 (600 mg dose) will be selected, however this depends on the evaluation of available PK and safety data from Part 1 of the study. Part 3: The following cohorts of 10 adult subjects each, with CHC infection, will be evaluated.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase IIb/III - IIT (Onset); BRIEF: The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of oral cyclosporine, an immune therapy and oral omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, are effective in rendering insulin independence among recent onset type 1 diabetes patients. This two-arm study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy for insulin independence of two FDA and EMA-approved therapies among recent onset type 1 diabetes patients. One of the greatest new insights of today in the field of type 1 diabetes, is the understanding that in man, unlike the success seen in type 1 diabetes mouse models, there is no beta cell regeneration with immune therapy alone. In man, type 1 diabetes is now considered to be a disease of both autoimmunity and lack of beta cell regeneration (Levetan 2103). More than 500 patients with new onset type 1 diabetes have been given cyclosporine and some studies have demonstrated as high as a 57% insulin-free remission rate that was not sustained due to the lack of beta cell regeneration (Feutren 1986, Bougneres 1988, Eisenbarth 1989, Sobel 2010). Studies among diabetes patients with proton pump inhibitors have shown the potential to increase beta cell mass by 40%, but among type 1 patients without immune protection, such outcomes cannot be not achieved (Singh 2012, Griffin 2014). The usage of a beta cell regeneration agent such as omeprazole, in combination with an immune tolerance, like cyclosporine, provides both the potential ability to maintain and regenerate beta cells. This is a new paradigm for the treatment of new onset type 1 diabetes. More than 60 human trials have been conducted among type 1 diabetes with a variety of different therapies aimed at preventing autoimmune attack on insulin-producing beta cells. None have been as effective as cyclosporine in both slowing the decline in beta cell mass and resulting in the potential for insulin-free remissions. (Canadian-European Randomized Control Trial 1988, Eisenbarth 1989, Skyler 1992, Sobel 2010). Because cyclosporine is known for its potential side-effects, most notably in the kidney, all previous studies among type 1 patients have carefully monitored kidney function. Follow-up studies for up to 13 years among 285 type 1 patients utilizing cyclosporine for 20 months did not demonstrate renal or other side effects at the dosages that will be used in this trial (Assan 2002). The most effective initiating dosage for insulin independence in the cyclosporine trials was 7.5 mg/kg/day, but for safety, this study will begin at a lower dosage of 5 mg/kg/day and will monitor kidney function and cyclosporine levels initially on a weekly basis. This study will use only those dosages of cyclosporine that have not demonstrated toxicity to the kidney or resulted in non-reversible side effects among more than 500 patients with recent onset type 1 diabetes treated with cyclosporine. Omeprazole has been shown to significantly increase gastrin levels which is associated with increased beta cells. Lansoprazole has also been shown to be safe among patients with new onset type 1 diabetes for one year with a trend toward increased beta cell mass among patients with higher gastrin levels. In a randomized trial for 12 weeks among 56 patients undergoing pancreatectomy, those randomized to receive a proton pump inhibitor had significantly increased gastrin levels, higher insulin levels and improved endocrine function by glucose tolerance testing and less pancreatic atrophy as measured by CT scans (Jang 2003). The recently completed REPAIR T1D trial among newly diagnosed type 1 patients used a proton pump inhibitor and GLP-1 therapies for 1 year for beta regeneration failed to meet its endpoint of increased stimulated C-peptide. Lack of maintenance or regeneration of beta cells was specifically noted to have likely been due to lack of usage of immune therapy to protect beta cells (Griffin 2014, Rigby 2014). Those patients in REPAIR T1D, who did achieve gastrin and GLP-1 levels above those in the control group had a trend towards improved preservation of C-peptide with a suggestion of a decreased rate of fall of C-peptide through 12 months (Griffin 2014 Appendix Supplemental data). Glucose levels also trended lower than controls in the intervention arm with gastrin levels above the control arm (Griffin 2014 Appendix Supplemental data). In humans, the newly forming beta cells are under the greatest immune attack among type 1 patients (Meier 2006). REPAIR T1D underscores the importance for both immune therapy with a regeneration therapy among type 1 patients (Griffin 2014, Rigby 2014). The combination of cyclosporine with a proton pump inhibitor has the potential to demonstrate maintenance and expansion of residual beta cells. This combination therapy provides the unique ability for patients to become insulin independent.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I/II - NLG0104; BRIEF: This 2-phase study will determine the safety of treating patients with malignant melanoma with the genetically engineered HyperAcute-Melanoma vaccine. It will establish the proper vaccine dose and will examine side effects and potential benefits of the treatment. The vaccine contains killed melanoma cells containing a mouse gene that causes the production of a foreign pattern of protein-sugars on the cell surface. It is hoped that the immune response to the foreign substance will stimulate the immune system to attack the patient's own cancer cells that have similar proteins without this sugar pattern, causing the tumor to remain stable or shrink. Patients 18 years of age or older with malignant melanoma may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with medical history and physical examination, blood tests, urinalysis, chest x-rays and CT scans. MRI, PET, and ultrasound scans may be obtained if needed. Participants will receive twelve vaccinations two weeks apart from each other. The vaccines will be injected under the skin, similar to the way a tuberculosis skin test is given. Phase I of the study will treat successive groups of patients with increasing numbers of the vaccine cells to evaluate side effects of the treatment and determine the optimum dose. Phase II will look for any beneficial effects of the vaccine given at the highest dose found to be safe in Phase I. Monthly blood samples will be drawn during the 6 months of vaccine treatment. In addition, patient follow-up visits will be scheduled every 3 months for the remaining first year (6 months) after vaccination and then every 6 months for the next 2 years for the following tests and procedures to evaluate treatment response and side effects: Medical history and physical examination Blood tests X-rays and various scans (nuclear medicine/CT/MRI) FACT-G Assessment questionnaire to measure the impact of treatment on the patient's general well-being.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - NTX-SBX (Norway); BRIEF: Persons dependent on opioids like heroin, morphine, or codeine have a high risk of relapse, overdose and overdose death. This risk is elevated even further following discharge from treatment or correctional institutions where patients have been detoxified. At the moment, state-of-the-art treatment is based on maintaining the dependence on opioids by daily intake of opioid medications like methadone or buprenorphine. Recently, a medication containing the blocking agent naltrexone was approved in the US; this does not maintain dependence but instead blocks heroin and other opioids for 28 days after intramuscular administration. This study will conduct a 12-week randomized comparison of naltrexone intramuscular suspension (XL-NTX) with daily buprenorphine-naloxone in OMT. Medication will start preceding discharge from a treatment or correctional facility to participating catchment regions in Norway. The main hypotheses are that XL-NTX will do equally well as - or better than - OMT on the proportion of biological samples negative for opioids, retention, self-reported use of alcohol and illicit drugs. Following the 12-week randomized period, there will be a 36-week period where participants can receive the study medication of their choice. After the end of the study, data from national registry databases can be collected for a further 12 months on outcomes such as recidivism, mortality and morbidity. ; DRUG USED: Vivitrol; DRUG CLASS: Non-NME; INDICATION: Substance Use Disorder; TARGET: Opioid receptors; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: University of Oslo; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Opioid dependence (DSM-IV TR) - Age 18 or above - Applied & Approved for Norway's national OMT program - Discharge within 30 days of inclusion from a controlled environment; e.g. inpatient treatment or correctional (prison) facility - Voluntarily seeking treatment for opioid dependence Exclusion Criteria: - Pregnant or breast-feeding - Acute or recurring severe psychiatric disorder, e.g. psychosis, suicidality - Serious debilitation of liver or renal function (e.g. Child-Pugh level C) - Use of excluded medication - Known intolerance to study drugs or their ingredients - Employment in firm manufacturing one of the study drugs or close relation to such person ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: Number of biological samples negative/positive for opioid agonists; SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: Use of other substances of abuse",Yes

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - OPN305-102; BRIEF: When a patient receives a kidney transplant particularly if the kidney is from an older donor or one who has had the kidney removed after their heart has stopped, there is a risk that the newly transplanted kidney may not function immediately. If the delay in function means that dialysis is needed in the first 7 days after the transplantation then this is known as delayed graft function or dDGF. Also delayed graft function that does not require dialysis but is present because the serum creatinine does not fall sufficiently is known as functional delayed graft function or fDGF. This problem is often due to an excessive inflammatory reaction to not having had a blood supply between the time of donation and transplant. OPN-305 is a monoclonal antibody that blocks Toll-like Receptor 2 which is thought to be partly responsible for increasing the risk of this inflammation. It is hoped that the effects of the inflammation will be reduced and therefore prevent dDGF and fDGF from occurring. The purpose of the study is to explore how effective OPN-305 is in preventing dDGF and fDGF as well as improving other measures of kidney function and the overall safety of the antibody. In the first part of the study, each patient received an Infusion of one of three possible doses of OPN-305 or a placebo and in the second part the most suitable dose of OPN-305 and a placebo would be used. The purpose of this second part of the study is to find out if a dose of OPN-305 which has already been tested in an earlier part of this study can prevent kidney graft dysfunction. For the purposes of this study, kidney function will be assessed using the composite of delayed graft function (dDGF) because dialysis is necessary in the first 7 days and functional delayed graft function that does not require dialysis but is present because the serum creatinine, a key measure of renal function, does not fall sufficiently (fDGF) in the first 7 days post-transplant. Protocol OPN305-103 follows out to 12 months post-transplant the clinical status and graft function of patients who have completed the 6-month post-transplant period under Part A or Part B of OPN305-102. ; DRUG USED: OPN-305; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Delayed Graft Function (DGF); TARGET: Toll-Like Receptor 2 (TLR2); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Opsona Therapeutics Ltd.; CRITERIA: Inclusion criteria INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS - First or second renal transplant recipient - for second renal transplantations; - The second transplant should NOT be due to rejection - Panel Reactive Antibody (PRA) should be <10% - Minimum 3 months since the loss of the first transplanted kidney - Dialysis-dependent at the time of transplantation as documented by: - Requirement for at least 2 dialysis sessions/week in the 56 days before transplantation INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR DONOR KIDNEY: - The donor kidney must be considered compatible according to local transplant guidelines - An ECD donor defined as: o Extended Criteria Donor defined as: - Donor ≥60 years of age - Donor 50-59 years of age with two of three of the following criteria present: - Death due to cerebrovascular accident - Pre-existing history of systemic hypertension - Terminal creatinine > 1.5mg/dL (132.6 µmol/L) - Kidney allograft maintained in cold storage with or without machine perfusion Exclusion Criteria EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS: - Use of an investigational drug in the 30 days before Study Day 1 - Participation in any other research - Known hypersensitivity to human monoclonal antibodies or any of the study-drug excipients - Previous hypersensitivity to basiliximab or anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) - History or known HIV, HBV, or HCV-positive - History of malignancy within the last five years, except excised squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia - Scheduled to undergo multi-organ transplantation - Planned dual kidney transplantation - Presence of clinically significant infections requiring continued therapy - Active tuberculosis - Existence of any surgical or medical condition, other than the current transplantation which, in the opinion of the investigator, might significantly alter the distribution, metabolism or excretion of study medication - Presence of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. - Current drug and/or alcohol abuse - History or presence of a medical condition or disease that in the investigator's assessment would place the patient at an unacceptable risk for study participation - Lactating or pregnant woman - Patient institutionalized by administrative or court order EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ALL DONOR KIDNEYS - DCD or SCD donor kidney - Terminal creatinine >3mg/dL - Donor who is known to have received an investigational drug for I-R injury or graft rejection (immunosuppressant) in the 48h before organ recovery - Participation in any other research (drug or non-drug) - Kidney donor <5 years of age or <20kg body weight - Living donor allograft - HLA or ABO incompatible kidney as defined by a negative cytotoxic crossmatch - Donor institutionalized by administrative or court order ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: Measure of Early Graft Function EGF; SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: Creatinine at 7 and 14 days and at 1, 3 and 6 months",No

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I - Pediatric Recurrent Brain Tumors; BRIEF: The early clinical development paradigm for chemotherapeutic agents has significantly influenced the development of therapeutic cancer vaccines. However, there are major differences between these two classes of therapeutics that have important implications for early clinical development. Specifically, the phase 1 concept of dose escalation to find a maximum-tolerated dose does not apply to most therapeutic cancer vaccines. Most therapeutic cancer vaccines are associated with minimal toxicity at a range that is feasible to manufacture or administer, and there is little reason to believe that the maximum-tolerated dose is the most effective dose. In a recent article from the biostatistics literature, Simon et al. write that ""the initial clinical trial of many new vaccines will not be a toxicity or dose-ranging trial but rather will involve administration of a fixed dose of vaccine … in most cases the dose selected will be based on preclinical findings or practical considerations. Using several dose levels in the initial study to find the minimal active dose or to characterize the dose-activity relationship is generally not realistic"". Consistent with these recommendations, the general philosophy of the phase 1 clinical trial is to facilitate a prompt preliminary evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of the personalized synthetic long peptide vaccine strategy. The proposed clinical trial will test a fixed dose of vaccine. There is considerable experience with the synthetic long peptide vaccine platform. The synthetic long peptide vaccine platform has an excellent safety profile, and the optimal dose appears to be based on practical considerations (solubility of the peptide). The dose to be tested in the proposed clinical trial is consistent with other similar cancer vaccine trials that have been recently completed or are currently ongoing. The sample size (n=10-20) will provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine. ; DRUG USED: Poly-ICLC; DRUG CLASS: Non-NME; INDICATION: Brain Cancer (Malignant Glioma; AA and glioblastoma (GBM)); TARGET: Interferon Receptor, Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Washington University School of Medicine; CRITERIA: It is anticipated that most potential participants will be consented following standard of care surgical procedure (biopsy, resection).

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - 101-08; BRIEF: This study is to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of idelalisib alone and in combination with rituximab in patients with CLL or SLL. This Phase 2 study will be the first time that idelalisib is administered to previously untreated patients with hematologic malignancies. Idelalisib has demonstrated clinical activity as a single agent in relapsed or refractory CLL and SLL with acceptable toxicity, which supports its evaluation in previously untreated patients. The study population is limited to patients over 65 years of age because younger patients are generally appropriate for standard immunochemotherapy regimens that are highly active. Since the mechanism of action of idelalisib is distinct from rituximab, it is hypothesized that the combination will be more active than either agent alone. This study will establish initial safety and clinical activity of idelalisib in combination with rituximab in patients with CLL or SLL. Cohort 2 of this study will establish safety and clinical activity of idelalisib alone in subjects with untreated CLL or SLL. ; DRUG USED: Zydelig; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)/Small Cell Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL) - NHL; TARGET: p110 delta/PIK3CD, PI3K/AKT pathway; THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: Gilead Sciences; CRITERIA: Key Inclusion Criteria: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed CLL or SLL. - Age ≥ 65 - Presence of measurable lymphadenopathy (defined as the presence of ≥1 nodal lesion that measures ≥ 1.5 cm in the longest diameter (LD) and ≥ 1.0 cm in the longest perpendicular diameter (LPD) as assessed by physical exam, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)). - CLL - Binet Stage C or Rai Stage III or IV or has active disease defined by meeting at least one of the following criteria: - Evidence of progressive marrow failure as manifested by the development of, or worsening of, anemia and/or thrombocytopenia - Massive (ie, > 6 cm below the left costal margin) or progressive or symptomatic splenomegaly - Massive nodes (ie, > 10 cm in longest diameter) or progressive or symptomatic lymphadenopathy - Progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of more than 50% over a 2-month period or lymphocyte doubling time of less than 6 months - Autoimmune anemia and/or thrombocytopenia poorly responsive to corticosteroids or other standard therapy - At least one of the following disease-related symptoms: - Unintentional weight loss ≥ 10% within the previous 6 months - Significant fatigue - Fevers > 100.4 F for ≥ 2 weeks without other evidence of infection - Night sweats for ≥ 1 month without evidence of infection - SLL - has active disease as defined above for CLL, except the lymphocytosis criterion does not apply - World Health Organization (WHO) Performance Status of ≤ 2 - For men of child-bearing potential, willing to use adequate methods of contraception for the entire duration of the study - Able to provide written informed consent Key Exclusion Criteria: - Prior therapy for CLL or SLL, except corticosteroids for symptom relief - Treatment with a short course of corticosteroids for symptom relief within 1-week prior to Visit 1 - Known active central nervous system involvement of the malignancy - Ongoing active, serious infection requiring systemic therapy.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase Ib - w/Erlotinib ; BRIEF: This open-label, multicenter study will assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous (IV) dosing of atezolizumab in combination with oral erlotinib or alectinib in participants with NSCLC. This study has two stages. In the erlotinib group, the combination treatment will be given to participants with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-treatment-naive, advanced (nonresectable) NSCLC in a safety-evaluation stage and to participants with previously untreated EGFR mutation-positive, advanced NSCLC in an expansion stage (Stage 2). In the alectinib group, for both the safety-evaluation and expansion stages (Stages 1 and 2), the combination will be given to participants who are treatment-naive with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced NSCLC. In Stage 1, erlotinib will be given at a starting dose of 150 milligrams (mg) by mouth (PO) once daily (QD) and the starting dose of alectinib will be 600 mg twice daily (BID), for 28 consecutive days during Cycle 1 and on Days 1 through 21 of each cycle thereafter. The starting dose of atezolizumab will be 1200 mg, administered every 3 weeks (q3W) starting on Day 8 of Cycle 1. If the starting regimen for a combination treatment is not tolerated, alternative doses and/or schedules of erlotinib and atezolizumab or alectinib and atezolizumab may be tested to determine potential recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for that combination treatment. In Stage 2, a potential RP2D and schedule for each combination treatment will be investigated in an expansion cohort. For both stages, continuation of treatment beyond Cycle 1 will be at the discretion of the treating investigator. Study treatment will be discontinued in participants who experience disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, are not compliant with the study protocol, or, in their opinion or in the opinion of the investigator, are not benefiting from study treatment. However, in the absence of unacceptable toxicity, participants with second-line or greater NSCLC who are still receiving atezolizumab at the time of radiographic disease progression may be permitted to continue study treatment. ; DRUG USED: Tecentriq; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC); TARGET: Immune System, Programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1) / Programmed death ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Hoffmann-La Roche; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Histologically or cytologically documented, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. - Participants in Stage 1 (Safety Evaluation) receiving erlotinib: No limit to the number of prior therapies (except for EGFR TKIs). - Participants in Stage 2 (Expansion) receiving erlotinib: i) sensitizing mutation in the EGFR gene and ii) consent to collection of tumor tissue samples before, during, and after treatment for biopsy and PD biomarker analyses. - Participants receiving alectinib in either Stage 1 or Stage 2: must be ALK positive as assessed by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved test and must not have received prior treatment for their advanced NSCLC. - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. - Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. - Measurable disease, as defined by RECIST Version 1.1 (v1.1). - Adequate hematologic and end-organ function. - Use of highly effective contraception (as defined by protocol) and until 5 months after the last dose of atezolizumab and for 3 months after the last dose of alectinib or for 2 weeks after the last dose of erlotinib, whichever is longer; Males must also refrain from sperm donatation during this same time period.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - FID-CHEMO; BRIEF: Anaemia and functional iron deficiency are common conditions in patients with lymphoid malignancies, conditions which reduce significantly the quality of life and increase morbidity and mortality. Traditionally, Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESAs) have been used, but recently their use has been shown to have a negative impact on overall survival in different oncology populations. Recently published data suggest that intravenous (IV) iron can be effective in anaemia treatment, even without ESAs. This exploratory study is the first clinical project with ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) in patients with lymphoid malignancies: the data generated may be used for further evaluations of the drug in larger populations. In this study, 1,000 mg of IV iron as FCM will be administered on the same day or within 24 hours before or after chemotherapy treatment. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of FCM in the correction of haemoglobin levels in anaemic subjects with lymphoid malignancies, undergoing chemotherapy. Secondary objectives aim to describe the safety and tolerability of FCM, and the effect of FCM treatment on iron status variables in subjects suffering from lymphoid malignancies. ; DRUG USED: Injectafer; DRUG CLASS: Non-NME; INDICATION: Anemia Due to Oncology Treatment; TARGET: Iron; THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: Vifor Pharma; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Subjects (male or female) aged ≥18, suffering from indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia on any chemotherapy excluding anthracycline containing. - Life expectancy at least 6 months. - Received at least 12 weeks (or 3 cycles) of treatment in the current course of chemotherapy before start of iron therapy. - 8.5 g/dL Hb 10.5 g/dL at time of randomisation. - Iron-restricted erythropoiesis as defined: - Stainable iron in bone marrow combined with transferrin saturation (TSAT) ≤20% OR - where the evaluation of stainable iron in bone marrow is not possible or available: - ferritin >30 ng/mL (women) or >40 ng/mL (men) and - TSAT ≤20% - Signed informed consent (before any study procedure). - Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I - CADUCEUS; BRIEF: The purpose of this study is to determine whether giving cardiosphere-derived stem cells (CDCs) to patients with decreased heart function and/or a large amount of damaged muscle after a heart attack is safe. CDCs are cells grown from small biopsy samples taken from the heart. Giving a patient their own CDCs is an investigational procedure that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for this study. In addition to determining whether this treatment is safe, the study will also examine whether it can decrease the amount of heart muscle damage and/or improve heart function after a heart attack. The amount of heart muscle damage and the function of the heart directly affects prognosis (the predicted course of the disease), and the development of heart failure and other complications some patients experience after a heart attack. By way of background, scientists and physicians believed, until just a few years ago, that heart muscle damaged after a heart attack could not be replaced. Recently, however, scientists discovered that new heart muscle can form, or be regenerated, and that this process can be enhanced (or increased) by the administration of large numbers of certain cells isolated from the heart or bone marrow. These cells can be stem cells, or cells derived from stem cells, and they may achieve their benefit by forming new heart muscle cells, becoming heart muscle cells themselves, or releasing substances which increase the ability of already existing stem cells to form new heart muscle. All of the studies conducted so far have been experimental and no cell type is approved for routine clinical care of patients with heart disease. However, studies involving bone marrow stem cells do indicate some small improvement in heart function and one large study demonstrated a decrease in clinical events in the group which received bone marrow cells. Investigators of this study decided to study CDCs because they come from a person's own body, and therefore have no foreign immune antigens which may be rejected. Since the cells come from the person's heart, they are more likely to form heart tissue. In addition, animal studies indicate no safety problems and that these cells are capable of forming heart muscle and blood vessel cells after heart attacks. The investigators are now studying whether the same is true in humans. ; DRUG USED: CAP-1001; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS); TARGET: Stem Cells/Other Cell Therapies; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Cedars-Sinai Medical Center; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria - Myocardial infarction due to coronary artery atherosclerotic disease.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - EU; BRIEF: A Phase III, multicentre, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects having anal fissure (AF) with AF-related pain. Subjects will undertake a 1-week screening period to provide baseline data and for assessment of eligibility. At the Baseline visit (Week 0), eligible subjects (having an average Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score of >4 for worst pain associated with or following defaecation) will be randomised on a 1:1:1 basis to one of the three treatment groups. Subjects will receive diltiazem hydrochloride 2% cream or diltiazem hydrochloride 4% cream or placebo cream. Study treatment will be applied in and around the anus, three times daily, for up to 8 weeks. Following the Week 0 Visit, subjects will be contacted by telephone during Week 1 to ensure adequate compliance with study treatment, to ensure that study drug is being tolerated and that any concomitant medications are used at a level consistent with that prior to randomisation. Subjects will return to the clinic for safety and efficacy assessments at Weeks 2, 4, and 8 and receive a follow-up telephone call at Week 12, following cessation of therapy. Concomitant laxatives and stool softeners will be permitted, as needed, during the entire study period (screening and treatment) to ensure that constipation or passage of hard stools does not confound evaluation or improvement of the condition. Fibre supplements will be allowed but should be continued at the baseline level. Instructions on the use of the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) diary will be issued to subjects to record fissure-related pain (NRS) and bowel symptoms daily during the 1-week screening period, to confirm eligibility and post-randomisation to record worst anal pain associated with or following defaecation (NRS) and daily overall AF-related pain (NRS). A record of the number of times the subject has defaecated, laxative and analgesic usage will also be made as well as the number of applications of study treatment, any changes to concurrent medications and any Adverse Events (AEs). In addition, at some or all study visits, subjects will record the Patient's Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) on a 7 point Likert scale, complete a Short Form 36 (SF-36) quality of life questionnaire and will undergo examination of their AF. Routine blood samples will be taken and the Skin Irritation Score (SIS) recorded for safety evaluations. Subjects may receive permitted medications for pain per Entry Criteria, but these should remain stable, where possible, up to the Week 8 Visit. Introduction of any new medication for AF will not be permitted unless the Investigator deems ""rescue"" intervention necessary. A subject will be deemed a treatment failure if rescue intervention is required and will have to be withdrawn from the study. Any subject leaving the study following randomisation for any reason will be asked to complete the Early Withdrawal Visit. This includes subjects who withdraw due to the development of AEs or intolerance, as well as subjects who require rescue intervention. These subjects will return for safety follow-up visits at their previously scheduled follow-up assessment appointments. If complete healing has occurred at the 2 or 4 Week visits, (i.e. prior to the end of the 8-week treatment period), subjects will be asked to continue applying the medication for the full 8 week course, up to the final assessment. Following the Week 8 visit (or Early Withdrawal Visit), subjects will be followed up for a further 4 weeks (following cessation of study medication) to note any AEs. All routine blood analyses (haematology and biochemistry) and plasma levels of diltiazem and of its principal metabolites will be analysed by central laboratories. ; DRUG USED: Dolizem; DRUG CLASS: Non-NME; INDICATION: Chronic Pain; TARGET: Calcium Channel; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: S.L.A.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I/II - GRASPALL 2012-09 (US); BRIEF: Asparaginase (Asp) is used during the induction phase of ALL treatment for children and young adults. Its efficacy is counterbalanced by its toxicity, mainly in patients 40 years or older. The efficacy rate in older adult population is lower than for children or young adults. A recent review on outcomes in older adults with ALL pointed out that there were significantly more drug reductions, omissions or delays in the older group as compared to younger adults and that asparaginase was the drug most commonly omitted. The investigational product ERYASPASE is a dispersion for infusion of homologous red blood cells (RBC) encapsulating E. coli L-asparaginase. A previous European phase I/II clinical study in children and adults (<55 yo) at first relapse of ALL was conducted to determine the optimal dose of homologous RBC encapsulating native E. coli Asp (GRASPA®) in 24 patients with relapsed ALL. The activity and safety profiles of 3 doses of GRASPA® (50, 100 and 150 IU/kg) in combination with standard chemotherapy were compared to free native Asp. The global safety profile is also improved, reducing hypersensitivity, liver toxicity and coagulation disorders. Study showed that a single dose of GRASPA® 150 IU/kg induced a depletion in plasmatic asparagine for 18.6 days, i.e. similar to that obtained with 8 injections of 10,000 IU/m² of free native Asp. A reduction in the incidence and severity of the allergic reactions and coagulation disorders were observed with GRASPA® (Domenech 2011). A French phase II study designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of GRASPA® in combination with a polychemotherapy regimen in ALL patients older than 55 yo at first diagnosis has been performed, and showed that both 100 and 150 IU/kg doses fulfilled the predefined criteria for efficacy and tolerability but the better profile of 100 IU/kg dose was considered the optimal dose in this setting. A phase II/III trial in adult and children patients with relapsed ALL is currently ongoing. Based on these results, the combination of ERYASPASE with the CALGB chemotherapy regimen appears to be an attractive combination for the treatment of adults patients with ALL/LBL. ; DRUG USED: ERY-ASP; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL); TARGET: Asparagine, Protein synthesis, Stem Cells/Other Cell Therapies; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: ERYtech Pharma; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Men and women aged 18 years and over - Diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma - Received no more than 1 prior treatment for ALL/LBL - Note: Patients who have received transplant during 1st remission are excluded since this would be considered a 2nd treatment - ECOG performance status 0-2 - Signed Informed Consent Form Exclusion Criteria: - Other serious medical illness other than that treated by this study which would limit survival to <2 years or psychiatric conditions which would prevent informed consent or compliance with treatment. - Presenting with a general or visceral contraindication to intensive treatment including: - uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease, including recent (<6 months) myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure, - Current Grade 3 or higher coagulopathy, thrombosis and/or hemostasis disorders, - Serum creatinine concentration, 1.5 times greater than the upper limit of laboratory normal ranges (ULN), except if related to ALL/LBL, - total bilirubin 1.5 times greater than the ULN, except if related to ALL/LBL, - transaminases (AST or ALT) levels, 5 times greater than the ULN, except if related to ALL/LBL, - An uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection or an active duodenal ulcer, until these conditions are corrected or controlled. - History of Grade 3 or higher allergic reaction with prior asparaginase treatment, - History of allergy to penicillin or related antibiotic - History of Grade 3 or higher blood transfusion incident according to US Biovigilance Network which refers to any transfusion followed by a major intervention (vasopressors, intubation, transfer to intensive care) to prevent death. - Presenting with anti-erythrocyte antibodies leading to the unavailability of phenotype compatible red blood cells. - Participation in a clinical study involving receipt of an investigational drug during the last 30 days. - Women of childbearing potential without effective contraception as well as pregnant or breast feeding women. - Patient receiving treatment likely to cause hemolysis or under phenytoin treatment. - Patient undergoing yellow fever vaccination. ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: Determination of the Maximal Total Dosage (MTD) based on number of patients presenting with related DLT; SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: Overall safety and tolerability",No

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I - Pilot Trial; BRIEF: Betathalassemia major is a disease of the blood and bone marrow. You were born with it and it has made you unable to make normal hemoglobin and red cells. You have been receiving red blood cell transfusions all your life. These transfusions do not cure your disease. The problem with transfusions is that they contain a lot of iron. With time iron builds up in your body and will eventually hurt some of your organs . Because of this buildup of iron , you are taking medicine that helps your body get rid of the extra iron. Today, the only other treatment is bone marrow or stem cell transplant. It can only be done when a matched donor is available. This is most often a brother, sister, or parent. Bone marrow transplant may cure betathalassemia major. If you have a transplant and it is successful, you will no longer have the disease. Without a matched sibling or parent, the standard treatment is to keep having transfusions. In the near future, we will be testing a new treatment for making normal hemoglobin and normal red blood cells. We have recreated the healthy hemoglobin gene in a test tube. We are able to use it and put it back into cells. This is called gene therapy. We have been able to put this gene into the stem cells of mice with thalassemia. These mice were cured. We now plan to take that gene and put it into stem cells from people who have betathalassemia major. We will then inject those stem cells back into that person's blood. In general, we can obtain more stem cells from the blood of a person than from the bone marrow . In order to do so, we must give that person a blood growth factor. The growth factor stimulates the bone marrow to make more stem cells. That growth factor is called granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF), or Filgrastim. The purpose of this trial is to find out if the drug GCSF has any side effects on you, and if you will make more stem cells in response to it. This trial is not a gene therapy trial. This trial will not help your thalassemia. ; DRUG USED: Thalagen; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Anemia; TARGET: Stem Cells/Other Cell Therapies; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Subjects must be 18 years or older - Subjects may be of either gender or of any ethnic background - Subjects must have a confirmed diagnosis of ßthalassemia major and have been enrolled in a hypertransfusion program with a confirmed annual transfusion of ≥ or = to 100 mL/kg/yr AND ≥ or = to 8 Transfusions of blood per year over a minimum of two years. - Patients must be off hydroxyurea (HU) or erythropoietin (EPO) treatment for at least three months prior to entry onto the study - Subjects must have a performance score of Karnofsky > or = to 70 of the time of entry into the study. - Subjects must have a normal EKG and a normal chest xray - Each patient must be willing to participate as a research subject and must sign an informed consent form. - Subjects must be splenectomized or have no palpable spleen - Negative pregnancy test, if female Exclusion Criteria: - Active infections including Hepatitis B and C, HTLV 1 and 2, West Nile Virus, and HIV 1 - Female patient pregnant or breast feeding - Patients with uncontrolled seizure disorders - Allergy to GCSF or bacterial E. coli products - History of sickle cell disease or sickle trait - History of thrombosis or known thrombophilia ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: Number of Participants With no Serious Adverse Events; SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: ",No
"TRIAL NAME: Phase I/IIa - Pedi CART-19 (UPenn); BRIEF: This is a study for children who have been previously treated for Leukemia/Lymphoma. In particular, it is a study for people who have a type of Leukemia/Lymphoma that involves B cells (a type of white cell), which contain the cancer. This is a new approach for treatment of Leukemia/Lymphoma that involves B cells (tumor cells). This study will take the subject's white blood cells (T cells) and modify them in order to target the cancer. The subject's T cells will be modified in one or two different ways that will allow the cells to identify and kill the tumor cells (B cells). Both ways of modifying the cells tells the T cells to go to the B cells (tumor cells) and turn ""on"" and potentially kill the B cells (tumor cells). The modification is a genetic change to the T cells, or gene transfer, in order to allow the modified T cells to recognize your tumor cells but not other normal cells in the subject's body. These modified cells are called chimeric antigen receptor 19 (CART19) T-cells. ; DRUG USED: Kymriah; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL); TARGET: Autologous Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells (CAR-T), Cluster of Differentiation 19 (CD19), Immune System, Stem Cells/Other Cell Therapies, T lymphocytes; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: University of Pennsylvania; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: Male and female subjects with CD 19+ B cell malignancies in patients with no available curative treatment options (such as autologous or allogeneic SCT) who have limited prognosis (several months to <2 year survival) with currently available therapies will be enrolled: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - REGULATE-PCI ; BRIEF: This study is designed to determine the efficacy of REG1 compared to bivalirudin in preventing periprocedural ischemic complications and major bleeding in patients undergoing PCI as a treatment for CAD. Bivalirudin has been studied in patients undergoing PCI in both ACS (NSTEMI and unstable angina [UA]) and elective PCI. In comparison to UFH, bivalirudin has shown similar rates of ischemic events while demonstrating a significant reduction in bleeding and an improved net clinical benefit. Evidence from previous studies indicates that pegnivacogin represents an extremely potent, chemically unique anticoagulant that can be reversed by anivamersen across multiple populations (refer to Section 1.2.2). The question that still remains is whether Factor IX (FIX) inhibition by pegnivacogin can result in fewer ischemic events than a previously studied agent while active control with anivamersen can preserve the benefit of reduced bleeding. The purpose of this study is to evaluate REG1 in an adequately powered definitive study with an open-label, multi-center, active-controlled, randomized design to answer that question. ; DRUG USED: Revolixys Kit; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCIs) for Stable Angina; TARGET: Coagulation Factor IX; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Regado Biosciences, Inc.; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: 1.
