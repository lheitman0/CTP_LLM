"TRIAL NAME: Phase I/II - HGT-SAN-055; BRIEF: Sanfilippo syndrome, or Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) III, is a rare lysosomal storage disease (LSD) caused by loss in activity of 1 of 4 enzymes necessary for degradation of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) heparan sulfate (HS) in lysosomes. MPS IIIA results from deficiency of the enzyme heparan N-sulfatase (sulfamidase). MPS IIIA symptoms arise on average at 7 months of age, with the average age of diagnosis at 4.5 years for the majority of patients. The central nervous system (CNS) is the most severely affected organ system in patients with MPS IIIA, evidenced by deficits in language development, motor skills, and intellectual development. In addition, there are abnormal behaviors including but not limited to aggression and excess motor activity/hyperactivity that contribute to disturbances in sleep.Overall, individuals with MPS IIIA have a marked developmental delay and significantly reduced lifespan of 15 years of age on average.

Imaging studies and other tests will be used to study the tumor before the start of treatment. - Participants will have 28-day (4-week) cycles of treatment. - Participants will have TRC105 intravenously once a week. The first infusion will take about 4 hours. The length of time needed for the infusion may be slowly reduced if it is well tolerated. - At the end of the first cycle (the first 4 weeks), the imaging studies will be repeated before continuing TRC105. - Participants will take TRC105 for as long as the tumor does not grow and the side effects are not too severe. They will have imaging studies at the end of every cycle to evaluate the tumor. ; DRUG USED: TRC105; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Brain Cancer (Malignant Glioma; AA and glioblastoma (GBM)); TARGET: Endoglin / Cluster of Differentiation 105 (CD 105); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: National Cancer Institute (NCI); CRITERIA: - INCLUSION CRITERIA - Patients must have histologically confirmed glioblastoma or gliosarcoma. - Patients must have evidence for tumor progression by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - PoC; BRIEF: Objectives of the phase 2 prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to assess safety and efficacy of TRO40303 administered just before balloon inflation during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for limitation of infarct size in patients treated for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The study is being conducted in 9 centres in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and France. One hundred eighty patients will be included. It will last one month per patient and its overall duration will be 11 months. The efficacy will be assessed by infarct size expressed as area under the curve for creatine kinase and troponin I (blood sampling at D1, D2 and D3), and also evaluated by Cardiac Magnetic Resonance. Safety will be assessed by - clinic evaluation, - blood samples (hematology, biochemistry, renal and hepatic function), - Recording and follow-up of major adverse events occurring during the first 48h after reperfusion (death, heart failure, AMI, stroke, recurrent ischemia, the need for repeat revascularization, renal or hepatic, vascular complication and bleeding). - ECG - Recording cardiac events during one month after AMI - Follow-up of global left ventricular function by Echocardiography at D3 and D30. Demographic and medical history at inclusion and non-cardiac events occurring during the first 30 days will be recorded. TRO40303 plasma concentration will be assessed at 15 min, 6h, and 12h post the end of administration. Sample size calculation assuming a reduction of 35% of the AUC for Troponin I release, for a statistical power of 85% and a probability of type I error of 0.05. Main analysis: between-group comparisons of AUCs for serum troponin I and CK release will be performed using O'Brien's method for multiple endpoints testing. Secondary analysis: comparisons of the CMR criteria described above will be performed using mixed model of ANCOVA. All analyses will be performed on the Full Analysis Set and Per protocol populations. Safety analysis: A comparison of the incidence of cumulative adverse clinical events between the groups will be performed by Fisher's exact tests. Subjects will undergo primary PCI and receive concomitant medications according to current standard of care. After coronary angiography is performed but just before balloon inflation is performed, patients who meet the enrollment criteria will be randomly assigned to either the control group or the TRO40303 group. Randomization is ensured by taking the treatment units in ascending and consecutive order in each strata (anterior/posterior as determined on ECG). Just before balloon inflation, ideally less than 5 minutes, and with a maximum of 15 minutes before balloon inflation and stenting, the patients in the TRO40303 group will receive an intravenous slow-bolus (35 mL/min) injection of 6 mg/kg of TRO40303 injected in peripheral IV.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - OPN305-102; BRIEF: When a patient receives a kidney transplant particularly if the kidney is from an older donor or one who has had the kidney removed after their heart has stopped, there is a risk that the newly transplanted kidney may not function immediately. If the delay in function means that dialysis is needed in the first 7 days after the transplantation then this is known as delayed graft function or dDGF. Also delayed graft function that does not require dialysis but is present because the serum creatinine does not fall sufficiently is known as functional delayed graft function or fDGF. This problem is often due to an excessive inflammatory reaction to not having had a blood supply between the time of donation and transplant. OPN-305 is a monoclonal antibody that blocks Toll-like Receptor 2 which is thought to be partly responsible for increasing the risk of this inflammation. It is hoped that the effects of the inflammation will be reduced and therefore prevent dDGF and fDGF from occurring. The purpose of the study is to explore how effective OPN-305 is in preventing dDGF and fDGF as well as improving other measures of kidney function and the overall safety of the antibody. In the first part of the study, each patient received an Infusion of one of three possible doses of OPN-305 or a placebo and in the second part the most suitable dose of OPN-305 and a placebo would be used. The purpose of this second part of the study is to find out if a dose of OPN-305 which has already been tested in an earlier part of this study can prevent kidney graft dysfunction. For the purposes of this study, kidney function will be assessed using the composite of delayed graft function (dDGF) because dialysis is necessary in the first 7 days and functional delayed graft function that does not require dialysis but is present because the serum creatinine, a key measure of renal function, does not fall sufficiently (fDGF) in the first 7 days post-transplant.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I/IIa - w/Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide (NCI); BRIEF: Background: The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy for treating patients with B cell lymphomas or leukemias that involves taking white blood cells from the patient, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, genetically modifying these specific cells with a type of virus (retrovirus) to attack only the tumor cells, and then giving the cells back to the patient. This type of therapy is called gene transfer. In this protocol, we are modifying the patient s white blood cells with a retrovirus that has the gene for anti-cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19) incorporated in the retrovirus. Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine a safe number of these cells to infuse and to see if these particular tumor-fighting cells (anti-CD19 cells) cause tumors to shrink. Eligibility: - Adults age 18-70 with B cell lymphomas or leukemias expressing the CD19 molecule. Design: Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed Leukapheresis: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti-CD19 cells. Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the patient. Treatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy and the anti-CD19 cells. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment. Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits will take up to 2 days. ; DRUG USED: Yescarta; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) - NHL; TARGET: Autologous Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells (CAR-T), Cluster of Differentiation 19 (CD19), Immune System, Stem Cells/Other Cell Therapies, T lymphocytes; THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: National Cancer Institute (NCI); CRITERIA: - INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - Titration Study; BRIEF: This is a study to demonstrate the feasibility of an individual dose titration scheme based on the systolic blood pressure with a dose range from 1.0 mg TID to 2.5 mg TID. Patients suffering from chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) or pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) will be included. After diagnosis by an expert center, patients receive medication three times a day starting with 1.0 mg TID. The first tablets are given in the hospital, then the patients are allowed to go home and take the medication at home. After 2 weeks, patients return to the hospital for an ambulatory visit and the dose may be increased based on the actual condition of the patient (blood pressure and adverse events). Several measurements will be performed to test the efficacy of the drug and whether there are any unwanted reactions to the drug (blood tests, ECG, 6 minute walk test, imaging by Echo, quality of life scores). The dose of the drug will then be increased further until unwanted effects may occur or the blood pressure drops to low. The highest dose tested will be 2.5 mg TID. After 12 weeks the patient is going to stay in the hospital again and a right heart catheter is performed to examine the changes in hemodynamics after 12 weeks of treatment with the drug. If the patients give their consent they can enter a long-term extension trial continuing on BAY63-2521 with the dose reached after 12 weeks. Every 3 months an ambulatory visit at the specialist center will be performed including measurements of safety (blood tests, ECG, clinical assessment) and efficacy (6 minute walk test, Borg dyspnea scale, NT-pro BNP). Blood tests and ECG have been removed begin of 2013 as safety parameter by amendment 7; furthermore Borg dyspnea score and NT-proBNP have been removed as efficacy parameter. Initially the inclusion of ten patients suffering from chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) or pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) was planned.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I; BRIEF: This study will evaluate the safety of a ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) implant placed in the eye to allow the release of CNTF directly on the retina. The results of this study may lead to a larger investigation of CNTF implants to treat retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a progressive degenerative eye disease that begins with loss of peripheral vision and night blindness and often leads to blindness in later life. Currently, there are no effective treatments for RP. Researchers have found, however, that certain proteins, called ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), can partially protect cells in the eye if given directly inside the eye. A major challenge in treating RP is to deliver medicine directly into the eye. One way to ensure that CNTF gets into the eye is to surgically place an implant inside the eye to release the protein. Patients 18 years of age and older with retinitis pigmentosa whose visual acuity is 20/100 or worse may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, eye examinations, and eye photographs. The eye examination includes measurement of visual acuity and eye pressure, examination of the pupils and eye movements, and examination of the lens and back of the eye. In addition, patients will have the following tests: - Visual field test: Patients look at a central spot on a white screen and tell the examiner whenever they see a small light appear at other places on the screen. - Electroretinogram (ERG): Electrodes are taped to the patient's forehead. Special contact lenses are placed on the eyes, similar to normal contact lenses, after the eye has been numbed with drops. The contact lenses sense small electrical signals generated by the retina. The ERG measures the electrical activity of the retina when it is stimulated by light. For the ERG recording, the patient looks inside a large, hollow, dark sphere, and sees flashes of light, first in the dark, and then with a light turned on in the sphere. - Optical coherence tomography: This test, done with the machine used to examine the eye, measures retinal thickness by producing cross-sectional pictures of the retina. Participants undergo surgery at the NIH Clinical Center in a 30-minute operation to place the implant in one eye. The surgery is done under local anesthetic. Before the procedure, patients are given a steroid injection along side the eye to minimize inflammation after surgery. Following the procedure, patients return for follow-up visits once a month for 6 months. At these visits, several of the exams described above are repeated to evaluate treatment effects and check for adverse side effects. After 6 months, the implant is surgically removed. Post-surgical care for both implant and explant surgeries include examinations the day and week after surgery to examine the wound, a high dose of steroid immediately after surgery, oral antibiotics for 7 days, and eye drops for 1 week to prevent infection and inflammation. ; DRUG USED: Renexus; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) (Ophthalmology); TARGET: Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor Receptor (CNTFR); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: National Eye Institute (NEI); CRITERIA: INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I - SAD/MAD; BRIEF: This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, first-in-human, 3-part study in which the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of orally administered AL-704 will be assessed in healthy adult subjects and in adult subjects with CHC infection. Part 1: Healthy adult subjects will receive one of 5 single ascending oral doses (SAD) of AL-704 ranging from 100 mg to 1,500 mg (Cohorts 1 to 5). Within each cohort subjects will be randomized to receive either AL-704 or placebo (n=8 per cohort; 6 assigned to AL-704 and 2 assigned to placebo), in a fasted state. The planned dose-escalation scheme may be changed based on the emerging PK and safety data. Two additional cohorts (Cohorts 6 and 7) may be enrolled for evaluation of additional doses at the discretion of the Sponsor and Investigator, based on the emerging pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, and the presence of an acceptable safety profile. Part 2: To assess the food effect on pharmacokinetics, 8 healthy subjects from one full Part 1 cohort who received a single dose of AL-704 or placebo in a fasted state, will receive the same single dose of AL-704 or placebo in a fed state in Part 2 after a washout period of 7-14 days (depending on PK results). It is expected that Cohort 3 of Part 1 (600 mg dose) will be selected, however this depends on the evaluation of available PK and safety data from Part 1 of the study. Part 3: The following cohorts of 10 adult subjects each, with CHC infection, will be evaluated.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I/II - Brazil; BRIEF: Relapsed acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) requires remission prior to allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) for optimal survival, but is a disease with poor response to chemotherapy. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haploidentical, Natural killer (NK) enriched peripheral blood cell infusions have shown safety in patients with poor prognosis AML. Though not powered for such an assessment, this trial showed a promising but not statistically significant trend in remission rate. NK cell therapy was limited by small numbers of NK cells attainable through leukapheresis. We have now demonstrated that large numbers of NK cells can be propagated ex vivo from a small volume blood draw, obviating the need for donor leukapheresis. The purpose of this trial is to determine the feasibility and maximum tolerated dose of expanded NK cells and estimate the toxicity of treating relapsed/refractory AML with fludarabine + high-dose cytarabine + G-CSF (FLAG) chemotherapy followed by haploidentical expanded natural killer (NK) cells. The first NK cell dosing cohort will be well below the currently-established safe dose of pheresis-derived NK cells, as expanded NK cells may have increased toxicity because of their activated phenotype. In order to avoid accruing patients at suboptimal doses, a dose escalation schema based on the principles of an accelerated titration design is used in this study to allow expeditious advancement up to the current safe dose of NK cells. ; DRUG USED: K-NK003; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML); TARGET: Natural Killer Cells (NK Cells); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: Obtained within 30 days prior to beginning the lymphodepleting conditioning regimen, unless otherwise specified. - Patients with relapsed AML, including Canadian Neurological Scale (CNS) disease or previous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which has failed remission to at least one cycle of standard or experimental reinduction chemotherapy, or primary refractory AML (primary AML that has failed remission to at least two cycles of induction therapy) - Availability of a haploidentical family peripheral blood donor selected for best possible killer cell inhibitory receptor (KIR) reactivity. - Patient age between 2 and 59 years, inclusive. - Patient must have recovered from the treatment-related toxicities of prior cytotoxic agents received in the 4 weeks prior to beginning treatment on this protocol, with the exception of cytopenias resulting from persistent disease, and alopecia. - ""Zubrod"" performance scale ≤ 2 or ""Lansky"" scale ≥ 60. - Adequate renal function defined as: - Serum creatinine ≤2 mg/dL for adults. - Serum creatinine ≤2 mg/dL or ≤2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) for age (whichever is less) for children. - Or, if serum creatinine does not meet above criteria, patient will be eligible if 24h creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2. - Adequate liver function, defined as: Total bilirubin ≤2 mg/dL and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase(SGPT) (ALT) ≤2.5 x ULN for age (unless Gilbert's disease or abnormal liver function due to primary disease). - Pulmonary symptoms controlled by medication and pulse oximetry ≥ 92% room air. - New York Heart Association classification < III - Negative serum test to rule out pregnancy within 2 weeks prior to registration in females of childbearing potential (non childbearing potential defined as premenarchal, greater than one year post-menopausal, or surgically sterilized). - Sexually active males and females of childbearing potential must agree to use a form of contraception considered effective and medically acceptable by the Investigator. - Negative serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - PATENT PLUS; BRIEF: Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a severe progressive disease with a high mortality. Although several drugs are available for the treatment of PAH none offer a cure, therefore there is still a high medical need for new treatments. Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is one of the chemicals involved in the pathways controlling vascular tone, which is impaired in patients with PAH. This causes constriction and thickening of the blood vessels wall in the lungs and increase of blood pressure in the lungs. This can lead to the very debilitating symptoms of PAH such as tiredness, shortness of breath on exertion, collapse and often the inability of the patient to perform their daily life activities. Inhalation of Nitric Oxide, which activates sGC is used to treat PAH, but its effect wears off as soon as inhalation stops. Direct stimulation of sGC using this new compound Riociguat may be a new approach for the treatment of PAH. The phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5)-inhibitor Sildenafil is one of licensed treatments for PAH. The Patent Plus is a double-blind, placebo-controlled safety study, designed to investigate the effect of Riociguat on blood pressure in patients with PAH when given in combination with Sildenafil. ; DRUG USED: Adempas; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) and Pulmonary Hypertension (PH); TARGET: Guanylate Cyclase (sGC); THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: Bayer; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - 18 to 75 years of age at Visit 1 - Male and female subjects with symptomatic PAH (Group I Dana Point Updated Clinical Classification 2008), a 6-min walking distance (6MWD) of more than 150 m, a pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) >300 dyn*s*cm-5, and a mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAPmean) ≥ 25 mmHg - For Study Part 1: subjects on stable pretreatment with sildenafil at a dose of 20 mg tid - Unspecific treatments which may also be used for the treatment of PAH such as oral anticoagulants, diuretics, digitalis, calcium channel blockers or oxygen supplementation are permitted.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I/II - NLG0104; BRIEF: This 2-phase study will determine the safety of treating patients with malignant melanoma with the genetically engineered HyperAcute-Melanoma vaccine. It will establish the proper vaccine dose and will examine side effects and potential benefits of the treatment. The vaccine contains killed melanoma cells containing a mouse gene that causes the production of a foreign pattern of protein-sugars on the cell surface. It is hoped that the immune response to the foreign substance will stimulate the immune system to attack the patient's own cancer cells that have similar proteins without this sugar pattern, causing the tumor to remain stable or shrink. Patients 18 years of age or older with malignant melanoma may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with medical history and physical examination, blood tests, urinalysis, chest x-rays and CT scans. MRI, PET, and ultrasound scans may be obtained if needed. Participants will receive twelve vaccinations two weeks apart from each other. The vaccines will be injected under the skin, similar to the way a tuberculosis skin test is given. Phase I of the study will treat successive groups of patients with increasing numbers of the vaccine cells to evaluate side effects of the treatment and determine the optimum dose. Phase II will look for any beneficial effects of the vaccine given at the highest dose found to be safe in Phase I. Monthly blood samples will be drawn during the 6 months of vaccine treatment. In addition, patient follow-up visits will be scheduled every 3 months for the remaining first year (6 months) after vaccination and then every 6 months for the next 2 years for the following tests and procedures to evaluate treatment response and side effects: Medical history and physical examination Blood tests X-rays and various scans (nuclear medicine/CT/MRI) FACT-G Assessment questionnaire to measure the impact of treatment on the patient's general well-being. The questionnaire is administered before beginning treatment, monthly during treatment, and during follow-up visits after completing the treatment. It includes questions on the severity of cancer symptoms and the ability to perform normal activities of daily life. ; DRUG USED: HyperAcute Melanoma; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Melanoma; TARGET: Immune System, Stem Cells/Other Cell Therapies; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: NewLink Genetics Corporation; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Histological diagnosis of malignant melanoma.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - DaBlaCa-11; BRIEF: Photodynamic diagnostic (PDD) is a technique where a photodynamic drug is installed preoperatively in the bladder. Mucosa cells with a higher metabolism than normal urothelial cells, e.g. cancer cells, absorbs this drug which is utilized during cystoscopy where blue light is absorbed by the drug, making the surgeon able to distinguish tumor cells from normal cells and thus being able to identify flat lesions and small papillomas missed in white light cystoscopy. The use of PDD at this primary transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURB) has been shown to be associated with a lower recurrence rate within the first year, probably mostly owing to a higher detection rate of small papillomas and dysplasia that therefore can be relevantly treated at an early stage. Despite the use of PDD at the primary TURB, a high number of patients experience an early recurrence and patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS) treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) may have recurrence of their CIS or recurrence of papillomas despite the peroperative use of PDD. Whereas the use of PDD is well established in the TURB setting, the use of PDD in the follow-up setting with flexible cystoscopy in the outpatient clinic is not investigated. Feasibility studies have been successful but the clinical relevance and benefits have not been investigated so far. Thesis The thesis of the study is that the use of PDD in the outpatient clinic in patients with a high recurrence risk undergoing follow-up flexible cystoscopy will result in diagnosis of papillomas earlier than by the use of conventional flexible cystoscopy in white light. Thus, a higher number of tumours can be treated in the outpatient setting without the need for procedures in general anesthesia. Furthermore, the number of follow-up cystoscopies can be reduced if PDD is used at the first cystoscopy following TURB. Aims To investigate whether the use of PDD when performing a flexible cystoscopy in the outpatient clinic can reduce the number of recurrences of large size papillomas that cannot be treated by simple fulguration without general anesthesia. Furthermore, to investigate whether the use of PDD in follow-up cystoscopy in patients with earlier complete response to BCG on CIS, can increase the detection rate of CIS recurrences. ; DRUG USED: Cevira; DRUG CLASS: Non-NME; INDICATION: Bladder Cancer - Imaging; TARGET: Unknown; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Jørgen Bjerggaard Jensen; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - All patients coming for first outpatient flexible cystoscopy 4 month after TURB without subsequent BCG instillations Exclusion Criteria: - Muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) - BCG treatment within the last year ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: Tumor recurrence; SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: ",Yes

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - REGULATE-PCI ; BRIEF: This study is designed to determine the efficacy of REG1 compared to bivalirudin in preventing periprocedural ischemic complications and major bleeding in patients undergoing PCI as a treatment for CAD. Bivalirudin has been studied in patients undergoing PCI in both ACS (NSTEMI and unstable angina [UA]) and elective PCI. In comparison to UFH, bivalirudin has shown similar rates of ischemic events while demonstrating a significant reduction in bleeding and an improved net clinical benefit. Evidence from previous studies indicates that pegnivacogin represents an extremely potent, chemically unique anticoagulant that can be reversed by anivamersen across multiple populations (refer to Section 1.2.2). The question that still remains is whether Factor IX (FIX) inhibition by pegnivacogin can result in fewer ischemic events than a previously studied agent while active control with anivamersen can preserve the benefit of reduced bleeding. The purpose of this study is to evaluate REG1 in an adequately powered definitive study with an open-label, multi-center, active-controlled, randomized design to answer that question. ; DRUG USED: Revolixys Kit; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCIs) for Stable Angina; TARGET: Coagulation Factor IX; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Regado Biosciences, Inc.; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - CRD-002; BRIEF: ADHD has been associated with persistent deficits in the efficient allocation of attention and supports the notion that regulation of the cholinergic system may improve these cognitive deficits in ADHD. It has been suggested that the effects of nicotine are most pronounced on tasks that demand effortful processing (Rusted and Warburton 1994). In addition, a recent theory proposes that the cholinergic system allocates additional attentional resources during tasks that are demanding (i.e. sustained attention, set shifting, etc; Sarter and Bruno 1997). Thus it may be that in ADHD, cholinergic systems are under-responsive or under-developed and thus stimulation of nicotinic receptors via nicotinic agents may result in improved cognitive performance particularly on tests requiring effortful processing. ; DRUG USED: Bradanicline; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD); TARGET: Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor - a7 subtype &lt;br&gt;(a7 nAChR) ; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Targacept Inc.; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - TRIAC-1; BRIEF: This therapeutical trial will be conducted in patients with the Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome (AHDS), which is mutations in MCT8. MCT8 is a thyroid hormone (TH) transporter which is crucial for the transport of TH from the blood into different tissues. Dysfunction of MCT8 results in a lack of TH (hypothyroidism) in tissues that depend on MCT8 for TH uptake. This local hypothyroidism in the brain of these patients causes severe psychomotor retardation. In addition, TH serum parameters are highly abnormal in AHDS: high T3, low T4 and normal TSH levels. The high serum T3 levels cause local hyperthyroidism in tissues that do not depend on MCT8 for cellular transport of TH, resulting in a low body weight and reduced muscle mass. Currently, no adequate treatment is available for the AHDS. A T3 analog that does not depend on MCT8 for its cellular entry could, at least partially, restore the abnormalities found in AHDS. Several in vivo, in vitro and animal studies have shown that the T3 analog Triac is a very promising candidate: 1. Triac binds to the same TH receptors as T3; 2. Cellular uptake of Triac does not depend on functional MCT8. Hence, in AHDS patients Triac will also be available in tissues that require functional MCT8 for TH uptake, e.g. the brain; 3. In vitro studies have shown that neuronal cells differentiate equally well in the presence of either Triac or T3; 4. In Mct8 deficient mice, Triac is taken up by the brain and suppresses serum TSH levels; consequently, serum T3 and T4 levels were lowered; 5. Triac is the treatment of choice in patient with the resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) syndrome. Patient with RTH have high serum TSH and thyroid hormone levels, which shows strong similarities to the profile found in AHDS patients; the longstanding experience with Triac in RTH indicates its safety and tolerability . Thus, Triac treatment could result in normalization of the abnormal serum TH values in AHDS patients. Furthermore, Triac could replace the function of T3 in tissues that depend on MCT8 for TH uptake (e.g. brain). The current trial will investigate if Triac treatment in ADHS patients 1. reduces the toxic effects of the high T3 levels 2. restores the local TH deficiency in brain. ; DRUG USED: Emcitate; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Endocrine Disorder; TARGET: Thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Erasmus Medical Center; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - clinically relevant mutation in the MCT8 gene, resulting in the clinical phenotype of AHDS.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I - HER2+ Cancers; BRIEF: HER2 is a protein that is over expressed in 20-30% of breast cancers. It is also found associated with lung, gastric, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers. Although there are existing therapies that can target HER2, most patients will eventually experience progression of their disease even though their cancer continues to express HER2. Therefore, new approaches are needed for treating tumors that express HER2. This clinical trial will use an investigational cancer vaccine called HER2 VRP or AVX901. The vaccine is based on a virus called Venezuelan equine encephalitis but it has been changed so it cannot cause active infection. Instead, the virus has been changed so it tells the immune system to attack cancer cells which make HER2. The objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety of immunization with HER2 VRP in patients with advanced or metastatic malignancies that express HER2, and to test whether immunization will causes a strong immune system attack against the cancer. ; DRUG USED: AVX901; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Breast Cancer; TARGET: HER2/neu or ErbB-2, Immune System; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: H.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - HER2 Positive; BRIEF: This phase II trial studies capecitabine and lapatinib ditosylate to see how well they work compared with capecitabine, lapatinib ditosylate, and cixutumumab in treating patients with previously treated HER2-positive stage IIIB-IV breast cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Lapatinib ditosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with cixutumumab, may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

Since treatment with AAT is expected to be a chronic treatment; stopping treatment will probably result in eventual loss of the preserved beta-cell function. Indeed, other investigational drugs aiming at beta cells preservation have shown that patients who were initially treated and maintained their initial beta-cell function, required continuation of treatment or they lost the beta-cell function. Therefore, in this extension study, patients who were previously treated with AAT and maintained clinically significant beta-cell function are offered a continuation of treatment, since they are likely to benefit from use of the medication. The proposed study is aimed to assess the long term effect of AAT in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus: safety and tolerability of treatment, and effect on beta-cell function. Subjects who have completed all visits of the 008 study will be offered to participate in the extension study. The study will be consist off two main arms as following: Arm 1: Subjects who maintained peak stimulated C-peptide secretion ≥ 0.2 nmol/L will continue treatment with AAT for up to 18 treatments according to the dosage group they were allocated to in the 008 study. Arm 2: Subjects who have not maintained peak stimulated C-peptide secretion ≥ 0.2nmol/L and subjects with peak stimulated C -peptide secretion ≥ 0.2 nmol/L who are reluctant to receive additional study drug.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - Belgium; BRIEF: Background: Patients who survive severe brain injury may develop chronic disorders of consciousness. Treating these patients to improve recovery is extremely challenging because of scarce and inefficient therapeutical options. Among pharmacological treatments, apomorphine, a potent direct dopamine agonist, has exhibited promising behavioral effects, but its true efficacy and its mechanism remains unknown. This pilot study aims to verify the effects of apomorphine subcutaneous infusion in patients with disorders of consciousness, investigate the neural networks targeted by this treatment and evaluate the feasibility of a larger double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial. Methods/design: This study is a prospective open-label pilot clinical trial. Six patients diagnosed with disorders of consciousness will be included to receive a 4-weeks regimen of daily subcutaneous infusions of apomorphine hydrochloride. Patients will be monitored for four weeks before the initiation of the therapy, closely during treatment and they will undergo a 4-weeks inpatient follow-up after washout, as well as a two-year long-term remote follow-up. Shortly before and after the treatment regimen, the subjects will receive a multimodal assessment battery including neuroimaging exams. Primary outcome will be determined as behavioral response to treatment as measured by changes of diagnosis using the Coma Recovery Scale - Revised (CRS-R), while secondary outcome measures will include the Nociception Coma Scale - Revised (NCS-R, circadian rhythm modifications using actimetry, core body temperature recording and night electroencephalography (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET), resting-state high-density EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The Glasgow Outcome Scale - Extended (GOS-E) and a phone-adapted version of the CRS-R will be used for long-term follow-up. Statistical analyses will focus on the detection of changes induced by apomorphine treatment at the individual level (comparing data before and after treatment) and at the group level (comparing responders with non-responders). Response to treatment will be measured at four different levels: 1. behavioral response (CRS-R, NCS-E, GOS-E), 2. brain metabolism (PET), 3. network connectivity (resting-state fMRI and high-density EEG) and 4. Circadian rhythm changes (actimetry, body temperature, night EEG). Discussion: Apomorphine is a promising and safe candidate for the treatment of disorders of consciousness but its efficacy, the profile of the responding population and its underlying mechanism remain to be determined. This pilot study will provide unprecedented data that will allow to investigate the response to apomorphine using multimodal methods and shed new light on the brain networks targeted by this drug in terms of metabolism, functional connectivity and behavioral response. The investigators aim to better define the phenotype of potential responders to identify them more easily and develop personalized patient management. This preliminary study will lay ground for a subsequent larger-scale placebo-controlled double-blind trial which will provide quantitative data on effect size controlled for spontaneous recovery. ; DRUG USED: NH001; DRUG CLASS: Non-NME; INDICATION: Chronic Vegetative State; TARGET: Alpha 1 Adrenergic Receptor , Alpha 2 Adrenergic Receptor, Dopamine 1 (D1) Receptor, Dopamine 2 (D2) Receptor, Dopamine 3 (D3) Receptor, Dopamine 4 (D4) Receptor; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: University of Liege; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - 18-55 years old. - Clinically stable, not dependent on medical ventilators for respiration. - Diagnosed as in an unresponsive wakefulness syndrome or minimally conscious state according to the international criteria and based on at least 2 consistent CRS-R in the last 14 days (one CRS-R in the last 7 days). - More than 6 weeks post-insult (starting the apomorphine treatment at 10 weeks minimum) - No serious neurological impairments others than related to their acquired brain injury. - No neurological medications other than anti-epileptic or anti-spasticity drugs within the last two weeks. - No use of dopaminergic medications other than apomorphine within the last two weeks. - Informed consent from legal representative of the patient (if patients recover, their consent will also be obtained).

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I/II - BID Dosing; BRIEF: The myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), most notably polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are a diverse but inter-related suite of clonal disorders of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (Tefferi et al., 2008). The MPN share a range of biological, pathological, and clinical features including the relative overproduction of one or more cells of myeloid origin, growth factor independent colony formation in vitro, marrow hypercellularity, extramedullary hematopoiesis, spleno- and hepatomegaly, and thrombotic and/or hemorrhagic diatheses (Tefferi et al., 2005). This is a multi-centre, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study, to be conducted in two phases: a dose-escalation phase (Part 1), to determine the safety and tolerability of momelotinib (CYT387), and to identify a therapeutic dose for the expanded cohort; and a dose-confirmation phase (Part 2), which will be a cohort expansion at or below the MTD of momelotinib. In the Part I dose-escalation phase of the study, subjects will be assigned to dose levels in successive cohorts starting with a dose in the first cohort of 200 mg BID (twice daily with doses taken approximately 12 hours apart). Doses will be escalated by 50 mg BID per cohort until dose-limiting toxicities are observed. The dose level at which ≥2 of 6 subjects develop a first cycle dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as the DLT level. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level below the DLT level. New dose levels may begin accrual only if all subjects at the current dose level have been observed for a minimum of 28 days from the first day of treatment. The dose level chosen for study in the dose confirmation phase of the study will be the MTD or a lower dose shown to have significant clinical activity (efficacy) as determined by the safety review committee.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - Neurofibromatosis; BRIEF: Formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) is important for tumor growth in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). It is known that tumors make a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and there are higher levels of VEGF in the tumors and blood of many patients with NF2. VEGF stimulates the formation of blood vessels that supply the tumor with nutrients and oxygen. PTC299 is an oral drug that has been shown to decrease production of VEGF in animal models of human cancer. In these animal models, oral PTC299 administration decreases VEGF levels in the tumor and in the bloodstream, decreases blood vessel numbers in the tumor, and significantly slows or halts tumor growth. Safety studies in research animals indicate good tolerability at doses and drug levels that are higher than those planned for the clinical studies. Results from Phase 1a studies in healthy volunteers indicate that PTC299 achieves levels of PTC299 in the bloodstream that are known to be active in animal models of human tumor. This Phase 2 study is designed to test the hypothesis that PTC299 will be tolerable and will show evidence of VEGF reduction, antitumor activity, and hearing improvement when administered orally to patients with NF2. ; DRUG USED: PTC299; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Neurofibromatosis (NF); TARGET: VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth factor); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: PTC Therapeutics; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Age ≥18 years - Diagnosis of NF2 - Presence of vestibular schwannomas - Evidence of progressive increase in vestibular schwannoma size or worsening hearing loss due to vestibular schwannoma - Adequate functional status (Karnofsky Performance Score ≥60) - Adequate bone marrow, liver, kidney function - If sexually active, willingness to use effective barrier or medical contraception - For women of childbearing potential, no pregnancy or breast-feeding - Discontinuation of other therapies (except corticosteroids) for the treatment of NF2 and resolution of any acute toxic effects of prior therapies - Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan, laboratory tests, other study procedures, and study restrictions - Willingness to provide informed consent Exclusion Criteria: - Uncontrolled hypertension, major bleeding, HIV infection, or recent acute cardiovascular event - Prior exposure to another anti-angiogenic therapy (eg, bevacizumab, sunitinib) ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: To assess the effects of PTC299 on tumor volume and/or word recognition in patients with NF2.; SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: To assess the effects of PTC299 on pure tone thresholds, brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAERs), and otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) in patients with NF2",No

Because of these activities, slowing cancer cell growth and causing cancer cell death, Kevetrin may help to treat tumors. ; DRUG USED: Kevetrin; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Solid Tumors; TARGET: p53; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Cellceutix Corporation; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Males / females, ≥ 18 years old, any race / ethnicity, who can provide written Informed Consent - Life expectancy ≥ 3 months - Pathologically confirmed solid tumor, locally advanced / metastatic, refractory after standard therapy, or for which no effective curative or surgical treatment options are available - Measurable disease on baseline imaging per RECIST 1.1 criteria - ECOG performance status ≤ 1 - Liver function: - Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X upper limit of normal - AST, SGOT, ALT, SGPT ≤ 2.5 X upper limit of normal, < 5 upper limit if there are liver metastases - Renal function: - Serum creatinine within normal limits - Hematologic status: - Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500 cells/mm3. - Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3. - Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL - Coagulation status: - Coagulation Prothrombin time ≤ 1.5 X upper limit - Partial thromboplastin time ≤ 1.5 X upper limit - Males must agree to use condoms during sex to prevent spillage of semen for the duration of the study and for 3 months after the patient leaves the study - Females in the study must not be pregnant or breast feeding and not planning to become pregnant or breast feed for the duration of the study, and for at least three months after study completion - Women of childbearing potential must commit to using a double barrier method of contraception, an intrauterine device, or sexual abstinence for the duration of the study and for at least three months after study completion - Serum pregnancy test for women of child bearing potential must be negative at entry into study - Written voluntary informed consent: the patient is capable of complying with the requirements of the written Informed Consent Form and complying with protocol requirements Exclusion Criteria: - History of significant disease that in the Investigator's opinion would put the patient at high risk on the trial - Cognitive impairment sufficient to render the patient incapable of giving informed consent - History of clinically significant psychiatric illness that would prevent the patient from providing a valid ICF and complying with protocol requirements - Unwillingness or inability to comply with procedures required in this protocol - History or presence of alcoholism or drug abuse within the past 2 years - Patients who have had a major surgical procedure within the past 6 weeks - History of HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C - Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections requiring systemic therapy - Women of childbearing potential who are lactating, pregnant or there is the likelihood of becoming pregnant within the coming 12 months; a positive serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin test at time of screening for entry into study - New York Heart Association Class III or IV, cardiac disease, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, unstable arrhythmia, or evidence of ischemia on ECG - Patients with a mean QTc interval greater than 480ms are excluded.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - ARTemis (Cambridge University); BRIEF: RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, fluorouracil, epirubicin hydrochloride, and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether giving combination chemotherapy together with or without bevacizumab is more effective in treating patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy works compared with giving combination chemotherapy together with bevacizumab in treating patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer. ; DRUG USED: Avastin; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Breast Cancer; TARGET: VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth factor); THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; CRITERIA: DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer - HER2-negative disease - IHC 0/1 OR IHC 2+ and FISH negative - Must meet 1 of the following criteria: - Unifocal tumor meeting 1 of the following criteria: - T2 or T3 tumors (radiological size > 20 mm) - T4 tumor of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or the skin - Inflammatory carcinoma with tumor of any size - Multifocal tumor meeting the following criteria: - The sum of each tumors' maximum diameter must be ≥ 20 mm (total radiological tumor size ≥ 20 mm) - Other locally advanced disease meeting 1 of the following criteria: - Any T stage with involvement of large or fixed axillary lymph nodes (radiological diameter > 20 mm or clinical N2) and primary breast tumor of any diameter - Any T stage with involvement of large or fixed axillary lymph nodes (radiological diameter > 20 mm or clinical N2), without a primary breast tumor identified and the presence of breast cancer in a lymph node must be histopathologically confirmed by lymph node biopsy (tru-cut or whole lymph node) - Embedded paraffin tumor block available from pre-chemotherapy biopsy and surgical specimen - Bilateral disease allowed - No evidence of metastatic disease - No prior breast cancer except for ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast surgically cured > 10 years ago - Any hormone receptor status PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: - ECOG performance status 0-2 - WBC > 3 x 10^9/L - Hemoglobin > 10 g/dL - Platelet count > 100 x 10^9/L - AST/ALT ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2 times ULN - Bilirubin normal - Isolated elevation of bilirubin to ≤ 3 times ULN with a presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome allowed if AST/ALT and alkaline phosphatase are within normal limits - Creatinine ≤ 1.5 times ULN - PT and PTT/aPTT ≤ 1.5 times ULN - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective barrier contraception - Must be fit to receive chemotherapy on this trial, in the opinion of the responsible clinician, as indicated by the following criteria: - No clinically significant cardiac abnormalities - No myocardial infarction within the past 6 months - LVEF normal (at least 50%) by MUGA scan or echocardiogram - No prior ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, arterial or venous thromboembolic disease, cardiac failure, inflammatory bowel disease, gastroduodenal ulcer, symptomatic diverticulitis, or bleeding diathesis - No uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP > 150 mm Hg or diastolic BP > 90 mm Hg) with or without antihypertensive medication - Patients with initial blood pressure elevations are eligible provided initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive medication lowers pressure to meet entry criteria - No other previous malignancy except basal cell carcinoma, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast treated by surgery only and disease-free for 10 years - No concurrent medical or psychiatric problem that might prevent completion of treatment or follow-up - No presence of active uncontrolled infection - No history of nephritic or nephrotic syndrome - No traumatic injury within the past 28 days - No evidence of other disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, places the patient at high risk of treatment-related complications - No nonhealing wound, peptic ulcer, or bone fracture PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: - No prior neoadjuvant endocrine therapy - No prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy - No major surgical procedure within the past 28 days - No concurrent full therapeutic dose of anticoagulants or aspirin > 325 mg/day, clopidogrel > 75 mg/day, or corticosteroids ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: Complete pathological response rates (tumor and lymph nodes); SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: Disease-free survival",No
