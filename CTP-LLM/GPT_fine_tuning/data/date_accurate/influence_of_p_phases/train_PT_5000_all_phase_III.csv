"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - Cardiogenic Shock (TRIUMPH); BRIEF: Tilarginine Acetate Injection is a new type of drug that temporarily stops the body from making a bodily substance called nitric oxide. The body may produce excess nitric oxide following severe heart damage leading to shock. During a heart attack, and especially after a blocked artery causing the heart attack is reopened, a large amount of nitric oxide is released into the heart muscle and into the blood. Normally small amounts of nitric oxide are good for the heart and blood vessels. However, when released in large amounts, such as during a heart attack, it may be harmful, by adding to the damage of the heart attack and lowering the heart's ability to pump blood to the body. It may cause blood pressure to be lowered and reduce the amount of blood flow to the body's vital organs. This may interfere with the body's organs being able to do their work. If Tilarginine Acetate Injection can stop extra nitric oxide from being made, the performance of the heart and blood flow to the organs may get better, which may result in the improvement of symptoms. The purpose of this study (TRIUMPH) is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of Tilarginine Acetate Injection compared to placebo (an inactive fluid that has no effect on the body but looks exactly like the medication being studied). The study will help determine whether Tilarginine Acetate Injection, by temporarily lowering the amount of nitric oxide released into the vital organs can improve blood pressure and the blood flow to the body's organs. ; DRUG USED: Tilarginine acetate; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS); TARGET: Nitric Oxide Synthase; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Arginox Pharmaceuticals; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Confirmed myocardial infarction (heart attack) - Confirmed persistent cardiogenic shock - Confirmed patency of the infarct related artery (heart attack artery has been opened through the use of a blood clot dissolving drug or a balloon or angioplasty heart procedure) - Less than 24 hour duration of cardiogenic shock (the time since the heart attack occurred and the artery was opened must be less than 24 hours) Exclusion Criteria: - Infection - Other cause of shock (not heart attack) - Shock due to heart valve disease - Severe heart valve disease - Right sided heart failure - Shock due to arrhythmia (irregular heart rhythm) - Severe kidney disease - Aortic dissection (tear in aorta) - Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (severe lung inflammation) - Severe brain damage - Severe irreversible multi-system failure (failure of multiple body organs) - Major chest or abdominal surgical procedure within 30 days except if prior CABG and reocclusion occurs - Primary pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs) - Age younger than 18 years - Requirement for emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or infarct-related artery occlusion (heart attack artery completely blocked) - Ongoing or recent participation in another clinical trial of an investigational drug - Prior enrollment in this study or rapid resolution of cardiogenic shock before treatment (shock gets better before study starts) - Positive pregnancy test in women who are of childbearing potential ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: All cause mortality at 30 days post randomization; SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: Number of patients demonstrating resolution of cardiogenic shock compared to placebo",No

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - Shingles Prevention Study (Aged 60 or older); BRIEF: The incidence and severity of HZ (or shingles), as well as the frequency and severity of its complications, increases markedly with increasing age. More than half of all cases occur in persons over the age of 60. Even without complications, HZ can interfere with an elderly patient's ability to perform essential activities of daily living, resulting in a loss of independence that is emotionally devastating and frequently irreversible. The most common complication of HZ in elderly persons is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), which frequently results in disordered sleep, chronic fatigue, anxiety and severe depression. Antiviral therapy has a modest impact on the acute phase of HZ. However, it does not appear to prevent the development of PHN. This study is a 5.5 year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, efficacy trial to determine whether vaccination with live-attenuated Oka/Merck varicella-zoster decreases the incidence and/or severity of herpes zoster (HZ) and its complications in adults 60 years of age and older. ; DRUG USED: Zostavax; DRUG CLASS: Vaccine; INDICATION: Chickenpox and Shingles - Vaccines and Treatments; TARGET: Immune System, Varicella Zoster Virus (VSV); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: US Department of Veterans Affairs; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Adults 60 years of age and older. - History of Chickenpox. - Have given written informed consent prior to enrollment. - History of varicella or long-term (greater than or equal to 30 years) residence in the continental USA.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - LLC 2007 SA; BRIEF: RATIONALE: Classical chemotherapy does not cure advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) despite new drugs. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody directed against CD20 surface antigen on B lymphocytes and leads to apoptosis of CD20 positive B lymphocytes. The highest response rate yet published in the treatment of first-line CLL has been obtained by the association of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR). Now, the question is whether this response can be improved, as some trials showed that eradication of minimal residual disease (MRD) in CLL is associated with a longer treatment-free and overall survival. Maintenance therapy using rituximab has been recently approved as a means of prolonging remission in patients with indolent non Hodgkin's lymphoma. Maintenance therapy with rituximab could be of interest in treatment of MRD in CLL and prolonging remission and survival times.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - Renal and Vascular Function; BRIEF: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of celecoxib on the efficacy and safety of amlodipine besylate on renal and vascular function in subjects with existing hypertension requiring antihypertensive therapy. Kitov Pharma Ltd. (Kitov) is developing KIT-302, an oral fixed combination drug product (FCDP) consisting of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine besylate and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) celecoxib, as a ""convenience reformulation"" FCDP to facilitate and improve patient compliance with the once a day (qd) administration of its individual components, amlodipine and celecoxib. The formulation of KIT-302 consists of amlodipine besylate and celecoxib co-formulated in a single immediate release tablet. However, for this study (KIT-302-03-02), commercial celecoxib capsules (CelebrexÂ®) and commercial amlodipine besylate tablets (NorvascÂ®) were separately over-encapsulated (OE) and matched placebos were used to allow for blinding. Kitov completed a phase 3 pivotal trial in subjects with newly diagnosed hypertension (KIT-302-03-01) demonstrating that the amlodipine + celecoxib combination was statistically non-inferior to amlodipine monotherapy with regard to reduction of blood pressure. Further, trends towards superior blood pressure lowering effects and improved renal function were observed for the combination. This study (KIT-302-03-02) was conducted to quantify the beneficial renovascular effects noted in the prior study in subjects with existing hypertension requiring antihypertensive therapy. On May 31, 2018, the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved KIT-302, under the brand name ConsensiÂ® (amlodipine and celecoxib) tablets [New Drug Application (NDA) 210045] for the following indication: ""patients for whom treatment with amlodipine for hypertension and celecoxib for osteoarthritis are appropriate.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - ADN011; BRIEF: The objectives of this study are to determine the efficacy and safety of BEGEDINAÂ® in subjects with steroid resistant acute graft versus host disease (GvHD). GvHD is a rare and complex immunological disease occurring in some recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCTs) and affecting principally the skin, liver and gastrointestinal (GI) tissues. The disease is life threatening and may be acute or chronic and the first choice treatment for patients with acute GvHD (Grade II or higher) is the immunosuppressive corticosteroid hormone methylprednisolone. However, some GvHD patients may be resistant to this treatment leading to disease progression and a high rate of morbidity and mortality, primarily from infections and/or multi-organ failure. There are currently no other satisfactory therapies. BEGEDINAÂ® is a therapeutic monoclonal antibody that recognises and binds to CD26 on CD4+ T lymphocytes. BEGEDINAÂ® reduces the activity of CD26 in these cells and inhibits the immune response leading to improvement in patients that have shown steroid resistance. This study is therefore aimed at demonstrating that BEGEDINAÂ® is a safe and effective treatment for steroid-resistant GvHD patients where no other such treatments are currently available. ; DRUG USED: Begedina; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Graft vs. Host Disease (GVHD) - Treatment; TARGET: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV, DPP-4); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Adienne SA; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - MATERIAL (AMC-UvA); BRIEF: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by lower respiratory tract (LRT) symptoms such as wheeze, cough and airway obstruction. Patients with asthma frequently suffer from exacerbations, which can be triggered by allergens and, in particular, viral respiratory infections. It has recently been shown that mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that neutralizes interleukin(IL)-5, markedly reduces the exacerbation rate in asthma patients with eosinophilic airway inflammation. Previous studies have indicated that in a mixed population (eosinophilic and non eosinophilic) of mild asthma patients, mepolizumab did not have an impact on lung function and asthma symptom scores upon allergen provocation, although it did on markers such as sputum and blood eosinophils. Together, these observations led to the hypothesis that mepolizumab treatment reduces the exacerbation rate by limiting virus-induced asthma exacerbations. The investigators hypothesize that neutralization of IL-5 during virus infection in patients with allergic asthma: 1. Reduces virus-induced bronchial inflammation 2. Attenuates virus-induced asthma symptoms, airflow limitation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. 3. Enhances cellular immune responses to the virus. The aims of this study are to: 1. To investigate whether IL-5 neutralization reduces the inflammatory response to viral airway infections in allergic asthma patients 2. To investigate whether IL-5 neutralization prevents or reduces asthma symptoms during virus-induced asthma exacerbations 3.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - DaBlaCa-11; BRIEF: Photodynamic diagnostic (PDD) is a technique where a photodynamic drug is installed preoperatively in the bladder. Mucosa cells with a higher metabolism than normal urothelial cells, e.g. cancer cells, absorbs this drug which is utilized during cystoscopy where blue light is absorbed by the drug, making the surgeon able to distinguish tumor cells from normal cells and thus being able to identify flat lesions and small papillomas missed in white light cystoscopy. The use of PDD at this primary transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURB) has been shown to be associated with a lower recurrence rate within the first year, probably mostly owing to a higher detection rate of small papillomas and dysplasia that therefore can be relevantly treated at an early stage. Despite the use of PDD at the primary TURB, a high number of patients experience an early recurrence and patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS) treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) may have recurrence of their CIS or recurrence of papillomas despite the peroperative use of PDD. Whereas the use of PDD is well established in the TURB setting, the use of PDD in the follow-up setting with flexible cystoscopy in the outpatient clinic is not investigated. Feasibility studies have been successful but the clinical relevance and benefits have not been investigated so far. Thesis The thesis of the study is that the use of PDD in the outpatient clinic in patients with a high recurrence risk undergoing follow-up flexible cystoscopy will result in diagnosis of papillomas earlier than by the use of conventional flexible cystoscopy in white light. Thus, a higher number of tumours can be treated in the outpatient setting without the need for procedures in general anesthesia. Furthermore, the number of follow-up cystoscopies can be reduced if PDD is used at the first cystoscopy following TURB. Aims To investigate whether the use of PDD when performing a flexible cystoscopy in the outpatient clinic can reduce the number of recurrences of large size papillomas that cannot be treated by simple fulguration without general anesthesia. Furthermore, to investigate whether the use of PDD in follow-up cystoscopy in patients with earlier complete response to BCG on CIS, can increase the detection rate of CIS recurrences. ; DRUG USED: Cevira; DRUG CLASS: Non-NME; INDICATION: Bladder Cancer - Imaging; TARGET: Unknown; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: JÃ¸rgen Bjerggaard Jensen; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - All patients coming for first outpatient flexible cystoscopy 4 month after TURB without subsequent BCG instillations Exclusion Criteria: - Muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) - BCG treatment within the last year ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: Tumor recurrence; SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: ",Yes

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - PROTECT-VIII Kids; BRIEF: Hemophilia A is an inherited blood disorder in which one protein, Factor VIII, needed to form blood clots is missing or not present in sufficient levels. Hemophilia A causes the clotting process to be slowed and the person experiences bleeds causing serious problems that could lead to disability. The current standard treatment for severe hemophilia A is infusion of FVIII to stop bleeding, or regular scheduled treatment to prevent bleeds from occuring. Due to the short half-life of FVIII, prophylaxis may require treatment as often as every other day. In this trial safety and efficacy of a long-acting recombinant Factor VIII molecule is being evaluated in 50 male subjects, < 12 years of age, with severe Hemophilia A. These subjects will receive open label treatment with long-acting rFVIII for approximately 6 months (or longer until 50 exposure days) on a regular schedule at least once every 7-days. Doses and dose intervals may be adapted to the subject's clinical need. A second group of patients will receive open label treatment with the same drug for 12 weeks on a regular schedule of 2x/week. Patients will attend the treatment center for routine blood samples and will be required to keep an electronic diary. Subjects will be offered participation in an optional extension study to collect observations for at least an additional 50 exposure days. ; DRUG USED: Jivi; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Hemophilia A; TARGET: Coagulation Factor VIII, Coagulation Factor X; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Bayer; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Males < 12 years of age - Subjects with severe hemophilia A - Previously treated with FVIII for > 50 exposure days Exclusion Criteria: - Subjects with current evidence of or history of inhibitors to FVIII - Any other inherited or acquired bleeding disorder - Platelet counts < 100,000/mm^3 - Creatinine > 2x the upper limit of normal - Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) / Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 5x the upper limit of normal ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: Annualized number of all bleeds; SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: Inhibitor development in the main study",Yes

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - Study 087 (Japan); BRIEF: Gaucher disease is an inherited deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCB) that leads to progressive accumulation of glucocerebroside within macrophages and subsequent tissue and organ damage; typically of the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and brain. The disease has been classified into 3 clinical subtypes based on the presence or absence of neurological symptoms and severity of neurological disease. Type 1 Gaucher disease affects an estimated 30,000 persons worldwide and is the most common. Type 1 Gaucher disease does not involve the central nervous system.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - 047; BRIEF: The diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in adults is established by laboratory testing in patients with an appropriate clinical history of hypothalamic pituitary disease. Two tests that are considered to be gold standard tests for the diagnosis of GHD are the insulin tolerance test (ITT) and growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) combined with L-arginine (L-ARG). However, these tests are either bothersome (given intravenously) to the patient or are linked with side effects. Therefore, an orally available compound like AEZS-130 (formerly ARD-07), if demonstrated to be safe and providing adequate sensitivity and specificity could be a welcome alternative and/or complement to the current available tests. The intent was to recruit 40 adult GHD (AGHD) patients and 40 healthy control subjects into this trial, but the original sponsor (Ardana Biosciences Ltd.) discontinued the study for financial reasons before this was completed. At the time of withdrawal of GHRH from the market in 2008, 42 AGHD patients and 10 normal controls had completed the study at 9 US sites.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - CLL10 (German CLL Study Group); BRIEF: RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and bendamustine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - GeparQuinto (Neoadjuvant); BRIEF: Anthracycline-taxane based chemotherapy regimens are recommended mainly by current guidelines for neoadjuvant application of systemic treatment. The addition of other cytotoxic agents, e.g. antimetabolites, vincaalkaloids, or platinum salts resulted in marginal increase in efficacy, but was associated also with an increase in toxicity. Recently, only the addition of the Her-2 antibody trastuzumab has significantly improved pathologic response rate. Therefore, two major strategies are followed in current research projects: - To improve the selection of patients according to their tumors' sensitivity to chemotherapy. - To implement small molecules with specific mechanism of action. Within the GeparQuinto trial, the first strategy is followed by: - The PREDICT substudy. A gene signature specific for the response to anthracyclines and taxanes will be prospectively evaluated for its ability to identify patients with chance higher than 50% for a pCR. The results may leed to a better risk-benefit ratio for the use of conventional chemotherapy. - Adapting further chemotherapy to the response of the tumor to the first couple of chemotherapy cycles. Based on the previous experience made by the GeparTrio study, patients not responding early have a low chance to respond with a pCR irrespective of the type of chemotherapy. So, if further chemotherapy is planned, therapy should be selected according to a favorable toxicity profile. The second strategy is followed by investigating in three parallel group comparisons the efficiency of three distinct small molecules which appear to be generally active in breast cancer: - Bevacizumab, an inhibitor of the VEGF pathway targeting tumor neo-angiogenesis. - Lapatinib, an inhibitor of the Her-1 and Her-2 receptor tyrosine kinase. - RAD001 (Everolimus), an inhibitor of the mTOR molecule, a central controller of tumor cell growth and angiogenesis and chemosensitizer. Treatment for patients participating in the GeparQuinto study will be allocated according to the Her-2 status of the tumor as well as according to the sonographic response after the first 4 cycles of treatment. Experimental therapy with bevacizumab, lapatinib, and everolimus (RAD001) will be randomly added in distinct settings. ; DRUG USED: Avastin; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Breast Cancer; TARGET: VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth factor); THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: German Breast Group; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - NTX-SBX (Norway); BRIEF: Persons dependent on opioids like heroin, morphine, or codeine have a high risk of relapse, overdose and overdose death. This risk is elevated even further following discharge from treatment or correctional institutions where patients have been detoxified. At the moment, state-of-the-art treatment is based on maintaining the dependence on opioids by daily intake of opioid medications like methadone or buprenorphine. Recently, a medication containing the blocking agent naltrexone was approved in the US; this does not maintain dependence but instead blocks heroin and other opioids for 28 days after intramuscular administration. This study will conduct a 12-week randomized comparison of naltrexone intramuscular suspension (XL-NTX) with daily buprenorphine-naloxone in OMT. Medication will start preceding discharge from a treatment or correctional facility to participating catchment regions in Norway. The main hypotheses are that XL-NTX will do equally well as - or better than - OMT on the proportion of biological samples negative for opioids, retention, self-reported use of alcohol and illicit drugs.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - FID-CHEMO; BRIEF: Anaemia and functional iron deficiency are common conditions in patients with lymphoid malignancies, conditions which reduce significantly the quality of life and increase morbidity and mortality. Traditionally, Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESAs) have been used, but recently their use has been shown to have a negative impact on overall survival in different oncology populations. Recently published data suggest that intravenous (IV) iron can be effective in anaemia treatment, even without ESAs. This exploratory study is the first clinical project with ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) in patients with lymphoid malignancies: the data generated may be used for further evaluations of the drug in larger populations. In this study, 1,000 mg of IV iron as FCM will be administered on the same day or within 24 hours before or after chemotherapy treatment. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of FCM in the correction of haemoglobin levels in anaemic subjects with lymphoid malignancies, undergoing chemotherapy. Secondary objectives aim to describe the safety and tolerability of FCM, and the effect of FCM treatment on iron status variables in subjects suffering from lymphoid malignancies. ; DRUG USED: Injectafer; DRUG CLASS: Non-NME; INDICATION: Anemia Due to Oncology Treatment; TARGET: Iron; THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: Vifor Pharma; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Subjects (male or female) aged â‰¥18, suffering from indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia on any chemotherapy excluding anthracycline containing. - Life expectancy at least 6 months. - Received at least 12 weeks (or 3 cycles) of treatment in the current course of chemotherapy before start of iron therapy. - 8.5 g/dL Hb 10.5 g/dL at time of randomisation. - Iron-restricted erythropoiesis as defined: - Stainable iron in bone marrow combined with transferrin saturation (TSAT) â‰¤20% OR - where the evaluation of stainable iron in bone marrow is not possible or available: - ferritin >30 ng/mL (women) or >40 ng/mL (men) and - TSAT â‰¤20% - Signed informed consent (before any study procedure). - Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - ABC (IST); BRIEF: Urinary incontinence is a prevalent condition that markedly impacts quality of life and disproportionately affects women. Overactive Bladder syndrome (OAB) is defined as symptoms of urgency and frequency with urge urinary incontinence (OAB-wet) and without urge incontinence (OAB-dry). Conservative first line treatments for urge incontinence combined with other OAB symptoms (OAB-wet) include behavioral therapy, pelvic floor training +/- biofeedback, or the use of anticholinergic medications. These treatment modalities may not result in total continence and often drug therapy is discontinued because of lack of efficacy, side effects and cost or because of not wanting to take a pill. Behavioral therapy and pelvic muscle exercises require consistent, active intervention by the patient which is often not sustained. Thus, the objective of the Anticholinergic vs Botox Comparison Study (ABC) is to determine whether a single intra-detrusor injection of botulinum toxin A (Botox AÂ®) is more effective than a standardized regimen of oral anticholinergics in reducing urge urinary incontinence. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the change from baseline in average number of urge urinary incontinence episodes over 6 months between groups. ; DRUG USED: Botox - Therapeutic; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Overactive Bladder (OAB); TARGET: SNARE Proteins (e.g. synaptobrevin, syntaxin, SNAP-25); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: NICHD Pelvic Floor Disorders Network; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Subject has signed informed consent. - Females at least 21 years of age - Five or more urge urinary incontinence episodes on a three-day voiding diary.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - w/PDT(Concordia); BRIEF: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a combination of a drug, porfimer sodium (Photofrin), which is activated by a light from a laser that emits no heat. This technique works to allow the medical doctor to specifically target and destroy abnormal or cancer cells while limiting damage to surrounding healthy tissue. The activation of the drug is done by lighting the abnormal areas using a fiber optic device (very fine fiber like a fishing line that permits light transmission) inserted into a flexible tube with a light called cholangioscope for the bile duct. The light will activate the porfimer sodium concentrated in the abnormal tissue, leading to its destruction. This research study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of PDT with porfimer sodium administered with Standard Medical Care (SMC) compared to SMC alone on the overall survival time of patients with non-operable advanced cholangiocarcinoma, a rare cancer of the bile ducts. It will involve 200 patients across North America and Europe. Other countries may participate if needed.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - Breast (Taxotere); BRIEF: Physicians are conducting a clinical trial for patients with advanced breast cancer. Breast cancer can be treated with chemotherapy which can affect the bone marrow, where blood cells are produced. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cells that fight infection and are produced in the bone marrow. If the neutrophil count becomes low due to chemotherapy, a potentially serious condition called neutropenia occurs. Neutropenia is serious because it can affect the body's ability to protect against many types of infections. Pegfilgrastim is an investigational drug being evaluated for its potential ability to increase the number of neutrophils. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of pegfilgrastim in preventing neutropenia following chemotherapy in patients with advanced breast cancer. ; DRUG USED: Neulasta; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Neutropenia / Leukopenia; TARGET: Granulocyte-colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSFR)/CD114; THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: Amgen; CRITERIA: - Advanced breast cancer - 18 years of age or older - Patients who will be receiving Taxotere (docetaxel) chemotherapy ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: Proportion of subjects developing febrile neutropenia; SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: Incidence of hospitalization and IV antiinfective use associated with FN; also chemotherapy planned dose on time",Yes

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - EU; BRIEF: A Phase III, multicentre, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects having anal fissure (AF) with AF-related pain. Subjects will undertake a 1-week screening period to provide baseline data and for assessment of eligibility. At the Baseline visit (Week 0), eligible subjects (having an average Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score of >4 for worst pain associated with or following defaecation) will be randomised on a 1:1:1 basis to one of the three treatment groups. Subjects will receive diltiazem hydrochloride 2% cream or diltiazem hydrochloride 4% cream or placebo cream. Study treatment will be applied in and around the anus, three times daily, for up to 8 weeks. Following the Week 0 Visit, subjects will be contacted by telephone during Week 1 to ensure adequate compliance with study treatment, to ensure that study drug is being tolerated and that any concomitant medications are used at a level consistent with that prior to randomisation. Subjects will return to the clinic for safety and efficacy assessments at Weeks 2, 4, and 8 and receive a follow-up telephone call at Week 12, following cessation of therapy. Concomitant laxatives and stool softeners will be permitted, as needed, during the entire study period (screening and treatment) to ensure that constipation or passage of hard stools does not confound evaluation or improvement of the condition. Fibre supplements will be allowed but should be continued at the baseline level. Instructions on the use of the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) diary will be issued to subjects to record fissure-related pain (NRS) and bowel symptoms daily during the 1-week screening period, to confirm eligibility and post-randomisation to record worst anal pain associated with or following defaecation (NRS) and daily overall AF-related pain (NRS). A record of the number of times the subject has defaecated, laxative and analgesic usage will also be made as well as the number of applications of study treatment, any changes to concurrent medications and any Adverse Events (AEs). In addition, at some or all study visits, subjects will record the Patient's Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) on a 7 point Likert scale, complete a Short Form 36 (SF-36) quality of life questionnaire and will undergo examination of their AF. Routine blood samples will be taken and the Skin Irritation Score (SIS) recorded for safety evaluations. Subjects may receive permitted medications for pain per Entry Criteria, but these should remain stable, where possible, up to the Week 8 Visit. Introduction of any new medication for AF will not be permitted unless the Investigator deems ""rescue"" intervention necessary. A subject will be deemed a treatment failure if rescue intervention is required and will have to be withdrawn from the study. Any subject leaving the study following randomisation for any reason will be asked to complete the Early Withdrawal Visit. This includes subjects who withdraw due to the development of AEs or intolerance, as well as subjects who require rescue intervention. These subjects will return for safety follow-up visits at their previously scheduled follow-up assessment appointments. If complete healing has occurred at the 2 or 4 Week visits, (i.e. prior to the end of the 8-week treatment period), subjects will be asked to continue applying the medication for the full 8 week course, up to the final assessment. Following the Week 8 visit (or Early Withdrawal Visit), subjects will be followed up for a further 4 weeks (following cessation of study medication) to note any AEs.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - INPULSIS-1; BRIEF: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic disease of unknown cause that results in scarring of the lung and there is a high unmet medical need for effective treatment to halt lung function decline, delay or avoid exacerbation (flare-ups), and ultimately to reduce the death rate. In a large Phase 2 trial (1199.30) (NCT00514683), investigating the effects of 52 weeks of treatment with BIBF 1120 in patients with IPF, a positive effect was seen on lung function of patients treated with high dose of BIBF 1120 compared to placebo. Hence it is the purpose of this trial to investigate and confirm the efficacy and safety of BIBF 1120 at a high dose in treating patients with IPF, compared with placebo. The trial will be conducted as a prospective, randomised design with the aim to collect safety and efficacy data. Respiratory function is globally accepted for assessment of treatment effects in IPF patients. The chosen endpoint (Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) decline) is easy to obtain and is part of the usual examinations done in IPF patients. ; DRUG USED: Ofev; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF); TARGET: Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) , Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), Src Kinase Family, VEGF Receptor (VEGFR); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Boehringer Ingelheim; CRITERIA: Inclusion criteria: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - REGULATE-PCI ; BRIEF: This study is designed to determine the efficacy of REG1 compared to bivalirudin in preventing periprocedural ischemic complications and major bleeding in patients undergoing PCI as a treatment for CAD. Bivalirudin has been studied in patients undergoing PCI in both ACS (NSTEMI and unstable angina [UA]) and elective PCI. In comparison to UFH, bivalirudin has shown similar rates of ischemic events while demonstrating a significant reduction in bleeding and an improved net clinical benefit. Evidence from previous studies indicates that pegnivacogin represents an extremely potent, chemically unique anticoagulant that can be reversed by anivamersen across multiple populations (refer to Section 1.2.2). The question that still remains is whether Factor IX (FIX) inhibition by pegnivacogin can result in fewer ischemic events than a previously studied agent while active control with anivamersen can preserve the benefit of reduced bleeding. The purpose of this study is to evaluate REG1 in an adequately powered definitive study with an open-label, multi-center, active-controlled, randomized design to answer that question. ; DRUG USED: Revolixys Kit; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCIs) for Stable Angina; TARGET: Coagulation Factor IX; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Regado Biosciences, Inc.; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - vs. SOC (ex-U.S.); BRIEF: Burns represent one of the most severe and dreaded traumas. Burned and traumatized tissue is known as eschar. The dead eschar, if not removed, often becomes heavily contaminated and is the source of local and/or systemic infection or sepsis. The local inflammation and infection destroy healthy surrounding tissues and extends the original damage. In order to prevent these complications, and in order to minimize the risk of infection, it is imperative to evaluate the burn and remove all of the offending eschar at the earliest possible opportunity. This removal of dead tissue is termed ""debridement"". The most direct debridement method for eschar removal is surgery. Traditional, conservative non-surgical debridement is a lengthy process which often involves many complications. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and enzymatic debriding efficacy of Debrase Gel Dressing (DGD) in hospitalized patients with deep partial thickness and/or full thickness thermal burns and to compare DGD to standard of care (SOC). ; DRUG USED: NexoBrid; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Burn Injury; TARGET: Eschar; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: MediWound Ltd; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: 1.

Even with palliative care and optimal use of medications, many patients still suffer enormously as the cancer spreads. Because of this, some cancer patients also try or use cannabis in different ways to relieve their pain and improve the way they feel. However, there has not been much high-quality research done yet to prove whether or not cannabis products are truly useful to relieve severe cancer pain. This study is to test if advanced cancer patients who use inhaled medical cannabis (PPP001), in addition to palliative care management, will experience improvement in quality of life and relieve uncontrolled pain, providing safety conditions. ; DRUG USED: QIXLEEF; DRUG CLASS: Non-NME; INDICATION: Chronic Pain; TARGET: Cannabinoid-1 (CB1) receptor, Cannabinoid-2 (CB2) receptor; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Tetra Bio-Pharma; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - SIRIUS (MEA115575); BRIEF: This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study of mepolizumab in comparison with placebo in reducing Oral Corticosteroid (OCS) use in subjects with severe refractory asthma. The study consists of four phases, OCS Optimisation Phase (Week -8 to Week 0), and the double-blind treatment period divided into an Induction Phase (Week 0 to Week 4), OCS Reduction Phase (Week 5 upto Week 20) followed by Maintenance Phase (Week 20 to Week 24). During the Optimisation Phase the investigator will adjust the OCS (prednisone/prednisolone) dose according to the Optimisation titration schedule based on a review of Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)-5 score and exacerbation. In the Induction Phase subjects will be randomized 1:1 (approximately 60 per arm) to receive either mepolizumab (100 mg) administered subcutaneously (SC) or placebo every 4 weeks in addition to their existing maintenance asthma therapy with the lowest dose of OCS from Optimisation Phase. The Induction Phase will allow sufficient time for those subjects randomised to the mepolizumab arm to achieve a decrease in the eosinophilic inflammation prior to the reduction in OCS. During the Reduction Phase, subjects will continue receiving 100 mg mepolizumab/placebo every 4 weeks and the OCS dose reduction will be done every 4 weeks using the reduction titration schedule based on a review of eDiary parameters recorded by the subject, the subjects' exacerbation history, and a review of the signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. In the Maintenance Phase subjects will be maintained without any further OCS dose adjustment. Subjects who complete the 24 week double-blind period and meet the eligibility criteria, will be offered the opportunity to participate in an open label extension (OLE) study otherwise they will return for a Follow-up Visit 12 weeks after their last dose of double blind study treatment. At each clinic visit, adverse events, safety labs, spirometery parameters and exacerbations will be assessed. The pharmacokinetic samples will be collected in the beginning of the treatment, prior to last dose, at the end of study (exit visit) and the follow up. ; DRUG USED: Nucala Lyophilized Powder Formulation; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Asthma; TARGET: IL-5 (Interleukin-5) and IL-5 Receptor (IL-5R); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: GlaxoSmithKline; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Informed Consent and Study Compliance: Subjects must be able to give written informed consent prior to participation in the study, which will include the ability to comply with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. - Systemic Corticosteroids: Requirement for regular treatment with maintenance systemic corticosteroids in the 6 months prior to Visit 1 and using a stable oral corticosteroid dose for 4 weeks prior to Visit 1.
