"TRIAL NAME: Phase IIIb - INSPIRING (TB Co-infection); BRIEF: HIV/Tuberculosis (TB) co-infection have profound effects on the host's immune system. TB is the most common cause of death in patients with HIV worldwide. Rifamycins (such as rifampicin [RIF]) are an important component of TB therapy because of their unique activity. The problem is that most protease inhibitors (PI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) used to treat HIV have significant drug-drug interactions with RIF that can lead to reduced concentrations of these agents with risk of treatment failure or resistance. The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) efavirenz (EFV) does not present the same significant drug interactions with RIF. EFV-based HIV treatment was tested in patients concomitantly treated with RIF-containing TB therapy, demonstrating that their co-administration can be used safely and effectively. However, the side effect profile of EFV overlaps with the RIF-containing TB regimens and makes the management of treatment toxicities very complex. Integrase inhibitors (INI), such as dolutegravir (DTG), may offer an important alternative to EFV-based therapy in TB coinfected patients. A Phase I drug-drug interaction study was conducted in healthy, HIV-seronegative subjects, and showed that DTG at 50 mg twice daily given together with RIF was well-tolerated and resulted in DTG concentrations similar to those of DTG 50 mg given once daily alone, which is the recommended dose for INI-naive patients. Therefore, ART regimens using DTG 50 mg twice daily may represent a new treatment option for TB-infected patients who require concurrent treatment for HIV infection. This is a Phase III b, randomized, open-label study describing the efficacy and safety of DTG and EFV-containing ART regimens in HIV/TB co-infected patients. This study is designed to assess the antiviral activity of DTG or efavirenz (EFV) ART-containing regimens through 48 weeks. A total of approximately 115 +/-5% subjects will be randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to DTG (approximately 69 subjects) and EFV (approximately 46 subjects), respectively. This study will include a Screening Period, a Randomized Phase (Day 1 to 48 weeks plus a 4-week extension), and a DTG Open-label extension (OLE). During the DTG OLE, subjects will be supplied with DTG until it is locally approved and commercially available, the subject no longer derives clinical benefit, or the subject meets a protocol-defined reason for discontinuation, which ever comes first. ; DRUG USED: Tivicay; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: HIV / AIDS; TARGET: HIV Integrase; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: ViiV Healthcare; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Subject or the subject's legal representative is willing and able to understand and provide signed and dated written informed consent prior to Screening - Adult subject (at least 18 years of age) with plasma HIV-1 RNA>=1000 copies/ milliliter (mL) at Screening - CD4+ cell count is >= 50 cells/ cubic millimetre (mm^3) at Screening - HIV-1-infected, ART-naÃ¯ve; (<=10 days of prior therapy with any antiretroviral drug following a diagnosis of HIV-1 infection) - A female subject may be eligible to enter and participate in the study if she: is of non-childbearing potential defined as either postmenopausal (12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea and >=45 years of age) or physically incapable of becoming pregnant with documented tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy or, is of childbearing potential, with a negative pregnancy test at both Screening and Day 1, and agrees to use one of the following methods of contraception to avoid pregnancy - Complete abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to administration of IP, throughout the study, and for at least 2 weeks after discontinuation of all study medications - Double-barrier method (male condom/spermicide, male condom/diaphragm, diaphragm/spermicide) - Approved hormonal contraception plus a barrier method while receiving Rifampicin (RIF)-containing TB treatment for subjects randomly assigned to the DTG arm or approved hormonal contraception plus a barrier method for subjects randomly assigned to the EFV arm (regardless of RIF-containing TB treatment) - Any intrauterine device with published data showing that the expected failure rate is <1% per year - Male partner sterilization prior to the female subject's entry into the study and this male is the sole partner for that subject - Any other method with published data showing that the expected failure rate is <1% per year - Any contraception method must be used consistently, in accordance with the approved product label and for at least 2 weeks after discontinuation of study drug.

Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether giving combination chemotherapy together with or without bevacizumab is more effective in treating patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy works compared with giving combination chemotherapy together with bevacizumab in treating patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer. ; DRUG USED: Avastin; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Breast Cancer; TARGET: VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth factor); THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; CRITERIA: DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer - HER2-negative disease - IHC 0/1 OR IHC 2+ and FISH negative - Must meet 1 of the following criteria: - Unifocal tumor meeting 1 of the following criteria: - T2 or T3 tumors (radiological size > 20 mm) - T4 tumor of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or the skin - Inflammatory carcinoma with tumor of any size - Multifocal tumor meeting the following criteria: - The sum of each tumors' maximum diameter must be â‰¥ 20 mm (total radiological tumor size â‰¥ 20 mm) - Other locally advanced disease meeting 1 of the following criteria: - Any T stage with involvement of large or fixed axillary lymph nodes (radiological diameter > 20 mm or clinical N2) and primary breast tumor of any diameter - Any T stage with involvement of large or fixed axillary lymph nodes (radiological diameter > 20 mm or clinical N2), without a primary breast tumor identified and the presence of breast cancer in a lymph node must be histopathologically confirmed by lymph node biopsy (tru-cut or whole lymph node) - Embedded paraffin tumor block available from pre-chemotherapy biopsy and surgical specimen - Bilateral disease allowed - No evidence of metastatic disease - No prior breast cancer except for ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast surgically cured > 10 years ago - Any hormone receptor status PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: - ECOG performance status 0-2 - WBC > 3 x 10^9/L - Hemoglobin > 10 g/dL - Platelet count > 100 x 10^9/L - AST/ALT â‰¤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) - Alkaline phosphatase â‰¤ 2 times ULN - Bilirubin normal - Isolated elevation of bilirubin to â‰¤ 3 times ULN with a presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome allowed if AST/ALT and alkaline phosphatase are within normal limits - Creatinine â‰¤ 1.5 times ULN - PT and PTT/aPTT â‰¤ 1.5 times ULN - Not pregnant or nursing - Negative pregnancy test - Fertile patients must use effective barrier contraception - Must be fit to receive chemotherapy on this trial, in the opinion of the responsible clinician, as indicated by the following criteria: - No clinically significant cardiac abnormalities - No myocardial infarction within the past 6 months - LVEF normal (at least 50%) by MUGA scan or echocardiogram - No prior ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, arterial or venous thromboembolic disease, cardiac failure, inflammatory bowel disease, gastroduodenal ulcer, symptomatic diverticulitis, or bleeding diathesis - No uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP > 150 mm Hg or diastolic BP > 90 mm Hg) with or without antihypertensive medication - Patients with initial blood pressure elevations are eligible provided initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive medication lowers pressure to meet entry criteria - No other previous malignancy except basal cell carcinoma, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast treated by surgery only and disease-free for 10 years - No concurrent medical or psychiatric problem that might prevent completion of treatment or follow-up - No presence of active uncontrolled infection - No history of nephritic or nephrotic syndrome - No traumatic injury within the past 28 days - No evidence of other disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, places the patient at high risk of treatment-related complications - No nonhealing wound, peptic ulcer, or bone fracture PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: - No prior neoadjuvant endocrine therapy - No prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy - No major surgical procedure within the past 28 days - No concurrent full therapeutic dose of anticoagulants or aspirin > 325 mg/day, clopidogrel > 75 mg/day, or corticosteroids ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: Complete pathological response rates (tumor and lymph nodes); SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: Disease-free survival",No

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - MVALDI; BRIEF: Previous studies suggests that M-Vax, a melanoma vaccine prepared from patients own cancer cells, can stimulated patients' immune system to react against their cancer. AVAX has identified a dose and schedule of administration of M-Vax that work optimally. In this study, AVAX will determine whether M-Vax is effective in shrinkage of melanomas that have spread (stage IV). To increase it effectiveness, M-Vax administration will be followed by administration of low doses of interleukin-2 (IL2), a marketed drug that is known to stimulate immunity and cause some shrinkage of melanomas. Two-thirds of patients will receive M-Vax + IL2, and one-third will receive a placebo vaccine + IL2. The study is blinded so that neither the patients nor their physicians know which material they are receiving. To be eligible for this study, patients must have at least one melanoma tumor that can be surgically removed and made into a vaccine. In addition, they must have melanoma that has spread to to the lungs or to soft tissue sites (under the skin, on the surface of the skin, lymph nodes). Eligible patients may have previously received one treatment (for example, chemotherapy) for their melanoma. Side effects of M-Vax are expected to be mild; the most common is the development of sore pimples at the site of vaccine injections. The low dose IL2 may cause some fatigue and other mild symptoms.

Giving combination chemotherapy together with cetuximab as first treatment after diagnosis of a metastatic colorectal cancer ('1st-line' treatment) may improve the treatment efficacy. However, it is not yet known whether giving combination chemotherapy together with cetuximab is more effective than combination chemotherapy alone. This open-label trial investigates the effectiveness of cetuximab in combination with a standard and effective chemotherapy (5-Fluorouracil (5FU)/Folinic acid (FA) plus irinotecan) for metastatic colorectal cancer in first-line setting, compared to the same chemotherapy alone on patient expressing the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. Patients expressing this EGF Receptor will be randomly assign in one of the 2 groups to either receive the combination chemotherapy alone or with cetuximab (open-label study) and will then be treated until progression of the disease or unacceptable toxicity occur. Regular efficacy assessments (every 8 weeks) based on imaging will be performed throughout the study together with regular safety assessments (e.g. safety labs). An independent Safety Board of experts will also monitor safety data. After participant discontinuation from the trial, regular updates on further treatments and survival status will be requested from the investigator. The entire study (from the first patient entering the study to the last collect of follow-up information) is 4-5 years long. ; DRUG USED: Erbitux; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Colorectal Cancer (CRC); TARGET: EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor); THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Diagnosis of histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum - Inoperable metastatic disease - Immunohistochemical evidence of epidermal growth factor receptor expression in tumor tissue - Presence of at least 1 bi-dimensionally measurable index lesion Exclusion Criteria: - Previous irinotecan-based chemotherapy - Previous chemotherapy for colorectal cancer except adjuvant treatment if terminated more than 6 months before the start of study treatment - Radiotherapy, surgery (excluding prior diagnostic biopsy) or any investigational drug in the 30 days before the start of study treatment - Brain metastasis ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: Progression-free Survival (PFS) Time - Independent Review Committee (IRC) Assessments; SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: Overall Survival Time (OS)",Yes
