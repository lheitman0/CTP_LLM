PBC is a slowly progressive disease characterized by damage of the bile ducts in the liver, leading to a buildup of bile acids which causes further damage. The liver damage in PBC may lead to scarring (cirrhosis). PBC may also be associated with multiple symptoms. Many patients with PBC may require liver transplant or may die if the disease progresses and a liver transplant is not done. This study has two main parts; the first part will compare a daily dose of elafibranor (the study drug) to a daily dose of placebo (a dummy treatment), and will last between a minimum of one year and a maximum of two years. In the second part, all participants will receive elafibranor, for a period between 4-5 years. The main aim of this study is to determine if elafibranor is better than placebo at decreasing the levels of a specific blood test (alkaline phosphatase) that provides information about participant's disease.

Sex 3. Male and/or female. Type of patient and disease characteristics 4. Individuals who have diagnosis of histologically confirmed NSCLC (WHO 2015 classification) with resectable (stage II-III) disease (according to IASLC Staging Manual in Thoracic Oncology v8.0). Select (ie, T3N2 or T4N2) stage IIIB patients will be eligible, provided that they are upstaged to T3N2 or T4N2 based on confirmed pathology. Patients who are staged asT3N2 or T4N2 prior to surgery are not eligible. 5. A contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scan of the chest must have been done for surgical planning prior to surgery. It is recommended that patients undergo combined FDG-PET (18F-Fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography) and CT scan (contrastenhanced or low-dose CT component) in order to rule out detectable extrathoracic, extracranial metastasis and to assess for potential mediastinal lymph node involvement prior to surgery. In the absence of pre-operative FDG-PET CT imaging, pre-operative contrast-enhanced CT imaging or MRI scan must cover liver and adrenal glands. If only CT is available, or FDG-PET reveals suspicious lymph node mediastinal involvement, it is recommended that invasive pre-operative mediastinal staging is performed according to the algorithm of the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons guidelines (algorithm to follow for primary mediastinal staging if only pre-operative CT is available [De Leyn et al 2007], algorithm to follow for primary mediastinal staging when PET-CT is available [De Leyn et al 2014]). It is preferred that imaging occurs within 6 weeks prior to surgery. Brain MRI (preferred) or brain CT with IV contrast is required for complete staging of the tumor. 6. Complete resection of the primary NSCLC is mandatory. The primary tumor must be deemed resectable by a multidisciplinary evaluation that must include a thoracic surgeon certified or trained according to local standards and who performs lung cancer surgery as a significant part of their practice. Surgical resection of the primary NSCLC can occur by open thoracotomy or by video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and resection can be achieved by segmentectomy, lobectomy, sleeve resection, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy. Patients undergoing wedge resection are not eligible for this study. Note: Patients undergoing segmentectomy must have tumors less than 2 cm in maximum diameter. Where a resection has been extended by means of a wedge resection of an adjacent lobe to ensure complete resection of a tumor at or crossing a fissure between lobes, this is acceptable if surgical margins are clear of disease. Where the resection of a second tumor nodule (eg, a T4 lesion) is undertaken by means of a wedge resection of a separate lobe, then the patient is not eligible. At a minimum, the following parameters should be met for a tumor to be declared completely resected: 1. The surgeon performing the resection should remove all gross disease by the end of surgery. All surgical margins of resection must be macroscopically negative for tumor. 2. Pathology and/or operative reports must include the examination of at least 2 different mediastinal lymph node (N2) levels, one of which is the subcarinal node-group (level 7) and the second of which is lobe-specific (defined below). Note: In the uncommon clinical situation where the surgeon thoroughly examines a mediastinal lymph node level and does not find any lymph nodes, that mediastinal lymph node level may be counted among the minimum 2 required levels. However, the surgeon must clearly document in the operative report or in a separate written statement that the lymph node level was explored and no lymph nodes were present. Normal appearing lymph nodes, if present, must be biopsied or removed. Exploration of nodes must clearly be documented in medical file if not recorded in operative report. Note: Lobe-specific lymph node stations are classified based on the location of the primary tumor as follows (based on IASLC 2009 lymph node map terminology [Rusch et al 2009]): Stations 2R and 4R for right upper lobe or middle lobe tumors, stations 4L, 5, and 6 for left upper lobe tumors, stations 8 and 9 for lower lobe tumors of both sides (Adachi et al 2017, Rami-Porta et al 2005). 3. No extracapsular nodal extension of the tumor is observed in resected mediastinal N2 lymph nodes. Note: Extracapsular nodal extension in resected N1 nodes is permitted. Note: The highest mediastinal node resected can be positive for malignancy. Note: Carcinoma-in-situ can be present at the bronchial margin. 7. All patients who enrol in the study prior to surgery must have a pre-surgical plasma sample collected for MRD evaluation. Patients will not be excluded from randomization based on the results of analysing the pre-surgical plasma samples. The following criteria must be met prior to signing ICF2: 8. Confirmation of suitable samples of resected tumor tissue and whole blood for WES of tumor and germline DNA, respectively, and creation of Sponsor-approved personalized panel for MRD detection. Tumor tissue and whole blood samples must be provided to the diagnostic laboratory for development of the personalized panel as soon as possible. Germline sequencing of whole blood is mandatory. Note: If a patient's tumor has less than the requisite 50 tumor-specific variants, a panel cannot be built and the patient will no longer be able to participate in the study. 9. Established MRD status (MRD+ or MRD-) based on Sponsor-approved personalized assay of a plasma sample collected at Week 3-5 (Day 21-35) post-surgery. 10. Known tumor PD-L1 status determined at a central reference laboratory testing service using a validated Ventana SP263 PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay prior randomization. Patients with unknown PD-L1 status are not eligible for the study. Criteria and procedures initiated with the signing of ICF2 11. Post-operative CT scan of the chest (including liver and adrenal glands) performed within 28 days + 7 days prior to randomization. If clinically indicated, additional scans (such as brain MRI [preferred] or brain CT with IV contrast) should be performed to confirm no evidence of metastasis. 12. ICF2 must be signed and dated after MRD status is determined and prior to initiation of any study-specific procedures, sampling, and analyses outlined in SoAs in Table 2 and Table 3. Randomization must occur within the 12 weeks (+ 7 days) following surgery. 13. WHO/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. 14. Complete postoperative wound healing must have occurred prior to randomization; patients must have recovered from all acute, reversible toxic effects from prior treatments (excluding alopecia) that could potentially adversely impact further administration of durvalumab/placebo or chemotherapy according to the Investigator's judgment. 15. Eligible to tolerate 4 cycles of platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy 16. Adequate organ and marrow function as described in the protocol. 17 Must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks Weight 18 Body weight >30 kg Exclusion criteria: Diagnostic assessments 1. Post-operative imaging demonstrating unequivocal evidence of disease recurrence or tissue biopsy-proven disease recurrence. In the event of lymphadenopathy on imaging that would lead to exclusion, histopathological confirmation of lymph node metastasis should be obtained prior to excluding a patient from the study. If pathological confirmation of lymph-node metastasis is not technically feasible and imaging appearance are deemed unequivocal for relapse, the patient will be excluded. 2. EGFR-mutant and/or ALK-translocation-positive, as assessed either from a pre-surgical biopsy sample (preferred) or the resected tumor tissue (if biopsy was not evaluable or available). Any of the following scenarios are acceptable for this study: Where EGFR/ALK results are obtained from a pre-surgical tissue biopsy as part of standard local practice, the patient must be confirmed EGFR/ALK wild-type prior to enrolling in the study. Results obtained from testing the patient's primary tumor tissue during screening for another AstraZeneca study may be used in this study. Results from local testing of a pre-surgical biopsy. All local EGFR/ALK testing performed locally must be performed using a well-validated, local regulatory-approved test. EGFR/ALK may be tested centrally if local testing is unavailable. Patients will still be allowed to continue with first screening procedures while testing is ongoing but will not be able to continue into second screening if their tumor tests positive for EGFR mutations and/or ALK translocations. 3. Mixed small cell and NSCLC histology. 4. Require re-resection or are deemed to have unresectable NSCLC by a multidisciplinary evaluation that must include a thoracic surgeon who performs lung cancer surgery as a significant part of their practice. 5.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - SWOG-S0777; BRIEF: This randomized phase III trial studies lenalidomide, dexamethasone, and bortezomib to see how well it works compared to dexamethasone and lenalidomide alone in treating patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth or by blocking blood flow to the cancer. It is not yet known whether lenalidomide and dexamethasone is more effective with or without bortezomib in treating multiple myeloma. ; DRUG USED: Revlimid; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Multiple Myeloma (MM);

A QTc interval of >470 msec by the Fridericia formula (QTcF), at the Screening ECG. If the subject's QTcF is >470 msec on the initial ECG, a total of 3 ECGs should be obtained at least 3 minutes apart and all within 30 minutes. The average of the 3 QTcF's will be used to determine eligibility. Known or suspected causes of prolonged QTc can be treated (e.g., hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesimia) and the ECGs may be repeated. If the subject initiates treatment with a drug known to prolong the QTc during the Screening period after the initial Screening ECGs were obtained, the Screening ECGs must be repeated once the new drug has reached steady state to ensure the average QTcF remains ≤470 msec. For subject's whose heart rate is <60 bpm, the Bazett correction formula (QTcB) may be used. 9.

Participants are put into 2 groups by chance. One group takes 1 empagliflozin tablet a day. The other group takes 1 placebo tablet a day. Placebo tablets look like empagliflozin tablets but do not contain any medicine. Empagliflozin belongs to a class of medicines known as SGLT-2 inhibitors. It is used to treat type 2 diabetes. During the study, the doctors check whether participants have additional heart failure events like needing to go to the hospital again because of heart failure. The participants answer questions about how their heart failure affects their life. We then compare the results between the empagliflozin and placebo groups. The doctors also regularly check the general health of the participants. ; DRUG USED: Jardiance; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Chronic Heart Failure - Reduced Ejection Fraction (Chronic HFrEF); TARGET: SGLT; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Boehringer Ingelheim; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Currently hospitalised for the primary diagnosis of acute heart failure (de novo or decompensated chronic HF), regardless of ejection fraction (EF).

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - EASE; BRIEF: This was a Phase III, Efficacy and Safety Study of Oleogel-S10 in Participants with Inherited Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB). EB is a rare group of genetic skin fragility disorders characterised by blistering of the skin in response to minor injury. In most cases, onset of EB is at birth or shortly after. All participants affected by any type of EB share the main characteristic of repeatedly developing painful wounds that take days to months to heal. Current treatment of EB is primarily preventative and supportive including protection from mechanical forces by avoiding rubbing, early treatment of wounds to prevent infections, and protection of the wound with adequate non-adhesive dressings to enable healing. The active pharmaceutical ingredient in Oleogel-S10 is a refined birch bark extract, quantified to 72 to 88% betulin. This clinical study of Oleogel-S10 in patients with inherited EB has been carried out to investigate whether Oleogel-S10 is effective for treatment of EB wounds and safe for long-term use. Oleogel-S10 was compared to a control gel. The control gel matched Oleogel-S10 in terms of texture and visual appearance to allow for double-blinding. The packaging for Oleogel-S10 gel and the control gel were identical. The participant received either Oleogel-S10 or control gel for a double-blind study phase of 90 days. The probability that the participant received Oleogel-S10 was 50%, which means that they had a 1 in 2 chance of receiving Oleogel-S10. However, in the follow-up phase of the study all participants were treated with Oleogel-S10 for a period of 24 months.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - 2-Period Crossover; BRIEF: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (or TTP for short) is a condition where blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout the body. The clots can limit or block the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the body's organs, such as the brain, kidneys, and heart. As a result, serious health problems can develop. The increased clotting that occurs in TTP uses up the cells that help the blood to clot, called platelets. With fewer platelets available in the blood, bleeding problems can occur. People who have TTP may bleed underneath the skin forming purple bruises or purpura, or from the surface of the skin. TTP also can cause anemia, a condition in which red blood cells break apart faster than the body can replace them leading to lower than normal number of red blood cells. A lack of activity in the ADAMTS13 enzyme, a protein in the blood involved in blood clotting, causes TTP. The enzyme breaks up another blood protein called von Willebrand factor that clumps together with platelets to form blood clots. Some people are born with this condition, others get the condition during their life. Many people who born with TTP experience frequent flareups that need to be treated right away. If not treated It can be fatal or cause lasting damage, such as brain damage or a stroke. BAX 930 is a medicine that replaces ADAMTS13 and can prevent or control TTP flareups, called TTP events. The main aim of this study is to compare the number of TTP events in people born with severe TTP when they treated with BAX 930 versus when they are treated with the standard treatment. Treatment will be given in 2 ways: - BAX 930 or standard treatment given to prevent TTP events from happening. - BAX 930 or standard treatment given to control an acute TTP event when it happens, according to the clinic's standard practice. Both BAX 930 and standard treatment are given slowly through a vein (infusion). At the first visit, the study doctor will check if you can participate in the study. If you are eligible and enter the study, you will follow an assigned schedule and either start with BAX 930 (Period 1) and then switch to standard treatment (Period 2) or start with standard treatment (Period 1) and then switch to BAX 930 (Period 2). Everyone will be treated with BAX 930 again for Period 3. Each Period will last approximately 6 months. If you enter the study to control an acute TTP event, you will follow a schedule receiving either BAX 930 or standard care to treat your acute TTP event. Once the acute TTP event has gotten better, you can decide to continue in the study and be given treatment to prevent TTP events from happening, following the schedule above. Another study's aim is to assess side effects from treatment with BAX 930 and standard treatment. To do that, the study doctor will ask you questions about your health at each study visit. The study doctors will also check how long BAX 930 stays in the blood of the participants, over time. They will do this from blood samples taken after participants receive their specific infusions of BAX 930. This will happen at different times during the study. 1 month after all treatment has been completed, participants will visit the clinic for a final check-up. ; DRUG USED: TAK-755; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP); TARGET: Von Willebrand Factor (vWF); THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: Baxalta now part of Shire; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Participant or legally authorized representative has provided signed informed consent >= 18 years of age and/or assent form (signed by legal representative if participants is <18 years of age). - Participant is 0 to 70 years of age, inclusive, at the time of screening.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - PDIGREE; BRIEF: This phase III trial compares the usual treatment (treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab followed by nivolumab alone) to treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab, followed by nivolumab with cabozantinib in patients with untreated renal cell carcinoma that has spread to other parts of the body. The addition of cabozantinib to the usual treatment may make it work better. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known how well the combination of cabozantinib and nivolumab after initial treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab works in treating patients with renal cell cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. ; DRUG USED: Cabometyx / Cometriq; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Renal Cell Cancer (RCC); TARGET: Angiopoietin Receptors (TIE-1 and TIE-2), FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT-3) , Hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met, HGFR), KIT/c-KIT, RET, VEGF Receptor (VEGFR); THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: National Cancer Institute (NCI); CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - STEP I REGISTRATION CRITERIA - Histologically documented renal cell carcinoma with clear cell component, including patients who have sarcomatoid or rhabdoid features - Any metastatic disease, including visceral, lymph node, other soft tissue and bone, measurable per RECIST 1.1. - Measurable disease as defined in the protocol. - Must be intermediate or poor risk patient per International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database (IMDC) criteria (1 or more of the following): Karnofsky performance status [KPS] < 80, < 1 year from diagnosis [including initial nephrectomy] to systemic treatment for metastatic disease, hemoglobin less than lower limit of normal [LLN], corrected calcium concentration greater than upper limit of normal [ULN], absolute neutrophil count greater than ULN, platelet count > ULN). - Central nervous system (CNS) disease permitted, if stable and not otherwise causing symptoms or needing active treatment. - Karnofsky performance status >= 70%. - No prior treatment with PD-1, PD-L1, or CTLA-4 targeting agents (including but not limited to nivolumab, pembrolizumab, pidilizumab, durvalumab, atezolizumab, tremelimumab, and ipilimumab), or any other drug or antibody specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways.

Note: If clearly attributable to liver metastasis, ALT (SGPT) values < 5 times the upper limit of normal are permitted. - Previous Therapy Failure of a treatment regimen is defined as the inability to continue a regimen for any reason including, but not limited to, progressive disease, toxicity, or patient request. Up to a maximum of three lines of chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic disease (defined below) and at least one of erlotinib or gefitinib for advanced/ metastatic disease (defined below) should have failed. Exchange of one chemotherapy agent for another within a combination chemotherapy regimen is not considered a new regimen in the following circumstances - carboplatin is substituted for cisplatin due to nephrotoxicity - one agent in the combination regimen is changed due to hypersensitivity occurring in the first cycle. Chemotherapy for Advanced/Metastatic Disease: Patients must have recovered from any reversible toxic effects and at least 21 days must have elapsed from the last dose and prior to randomization (14 days from the last dose for chemotherapy regimens administered on a weekly schedule). Further palliative cytotoxic chemotherapy must not be planned. Patients < 70 years: • Must have received 1 and up to a maximum of 3prior chemotherapy regimens (at least one of the three must have been a combination regimen and at least one must have contained platinum). Patients ≥ 70 years (generally accepted as being at the time of the administration of the first regimen of chemotherapy for advanced disease): • Must have received 1 and up to a maximum of 3 prior chemotherapy regimens for their disease. These may have been single agent chemotherapy regimens and a platinum agent is not required in keeping with current standards of practice. Adjuvant Chemotherapy: Patients may ALSO have had prior adjuvant therapy for completely resected disease, providing completed at least 12 months prior to randomization. Adjuvant regimens < 12 months prior to randomization and combined chemotherapy/radiation regimens for irresectable locally advanced stage III disease (irrespective of timing), are considered to be for advanced/metastatic disease and constitute one of the 3 permissible regimens. Patients must have recovered from any reversible treatment related toxicities prior to randomization. EGFR Inhibitor Therapy: Patients may only be enrolled after failure of prior gefitinib or erlotinib for advanced or metastatic disease. Patients who have received adjuvant gefitinib or erlotinib for completely resected NSCLC and who have recurred < 12 months after discontinuing erlotinib or gefitinib are eligible. Patients who received gefitinib or erlotinib for neoadjuvant therapy only are not eligible. EGFR inhibitor therapy must have been discontinued at least 21 days prior to randomization. Patients who discontinued prior gefitinib or erlotinib therapy for severe or life threatening organ toxicity are not eligible. Patients may also have received other EGFR active agents (such as reversible oral agents or monoclonal antibodies or vaccines) in addition to erlotinib or gefitinib but may not have received ANY prior irreversible EGFR inhibitor such as BIBW2992, HKI-272 (neratinib). Maintenance Therapy: The same chemotherapy or agent/s continued for longer than 4-6 cycles for the purposes of 'maintenance' is considered one regimen; if another chemotherapy agent is given with 'maintenance' intent, it is considered a second regimen providing that 'failure' is documented. Patients who received erlotinib or gefitinib with 'maintenance' intent after completion of 1st line chemotherapy are eligible providing that 'failure' is documented. Radiation: Patients may have had prior radiation therapy provided that a minimum of 14 days has elapsed between the end of radiotherapy and randomization onto the study. (Exceptions may be made however, for low dose, non-myelosuppressive radiotherapy. Patients must have recovered from any acute toxic effects from radiation prior to randomization. Previous Surgery: Previous surgery is permitted provided that wound healing has occurred and at least 14 days have elapsed (major surgery). - Patient able (i.e. sufficiently fluent) and willing to complete the quality of life questionnaires. The baseline assessment must already have been completed. Inability (illiteracy, loss of sight, or other equivalent reason) to complete the questionnaires will not make the patient ineligible for the study. However, ability but unwillingness to complete the questionnaires will make the patient ineligible. - Patient consent must be appropriately obtained in accordance with applicable local and regulatory requirements. Each patient must sign a consent form prior to enrollment in the trial to document their willingness to participate. - Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. All randomized patients must be followed and treated at participating centres. Investigators must assure themselves the patients randomized on this trial will be available for complete documentation of the treatment, adverse events, and follow-up. - In accordance with NCIC CTG policy, protocol treatment is to begin within 2 working days of patient randomization.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase IIIb - DAWNING (vs. Lopinavir/Ritonavir); BRIEF: For treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1), publicly funded programmes tend to follow World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines to use a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) combined with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) for first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART); however, there is a need for further data on the best treatment options for people with HIV-1 who have virological failure with this first-line regimen. The number of patients failing on their first-line regimen is increasing thereby requiring a switch to second-line treatment to reduce accumulation of drug-resistance mutations, disease progression, HIV transmission, and death. WHO guidelines recommend second-line antiretroviral therapy for adults consisting of two NRTIs + a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI); atazanavir (ATV) plus ritonavir (RTV) or lopinavir (LPV)/RTV are the preferred boosted PI options. This study is conducted to demonstrate non-inferior antiviral activity at 48 weeks of a dolutegravir (DTG) containing regimen compared to a WHO-recommended standard of care regimen for second line treatment, LPV/RTV + two NRTIs, in HIV-1 infected patients failing first line therapy. This study comprises of a Screening Phase (approximately 28 to 42 days), a Randomized Phase (Day 1 to Week 48 plus a 4-week treatment extension), and a Continuation Phase. Approximately 612 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive DTG 50 milligram (mg) once daily or LPV/RTV (800/200 mg once daily or 400/100 mg twice daily, in accordance with investigator decision and local label), each added to an investigator selected background regimen of two NRTIs at least one of which needs to be fully active based on viral resistance testing at Screening. Subjects randomized to the LPV/RTV arm will either (i) continue receiving LPV/RTV and complete the study after the 4-week treatment extension at Week 52, or (ii) switch to the DTG arm prior to study completion at Week 52 and continue to have access to DTG in the Continuation Phase. Subjects randomized to receive DTG who successfully complete 52 weeks of treatment and subjects originally randomized to receive LPV/RTV but switched to DTG prior to Week 52 will continue to have access to DTG until it is either locally approved and commercial supplies are available to patients or the patient no longer derives clinical benefit, or the patient meets a protocol-defined reason for discontinuation. ; DRUG USED: Tivicay; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: HIV / AIDS; TARGET: HIV Integrase; THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: ViiV Healthcare; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - HIV-1 infected subjects >=18 years of age. - A female subject may be eligible to enter and participate in the study if she: is of non-childbearing potential defined as either post-menopausal (12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea and >=45 years of age) or physically incapable of becoming pregnant with documented tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy or, is of child-bearing potential, with a negative pregnancy test at both Screening and Day 1 and agrees to use one of the protocol-defined methods of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for at least 2 weeks after discontinuation of all study medication. - HIV-1 infection as documented by HIV-1 RNA >=400 c/mL at Screening. - Subject has been on a first-line treatment regimen consisting of an NNRTI plus two NRTIs for at least 6 months and is currently experiencing virologic failure to this first-line regimen defined as two consecutive (>=7 days apart) HIV-1 RNA results of >=400 c/mL. - Subjects must receive at least one fully active agent within the dual-NRTI background regimen for second line treatment.

Where local center regulations prohibit submission of blocks of tumor tissue, two 2 mm cores of tumor from the block and 5-20 unstained slides of whole sections of representative tumor tissue are preferred. Where it is not possible to obtain two 2 mm cores of tumor from the block, 5-20 unstained slides of representative tumor tissue are also acceptable. Where no previously resected or biopsied tumor tissue exists or is available, on the approval of the Sponsor/designated CRO, the patient may still be considered eligible for the study. 20. Patient must consent to provision of a sample of blood in order that the specific correlative marker assays (Correlative Studies) may be conducted. 21.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase III - GeparDouze (NSABP Foundation); BRIEF: The main purpose of this study is to learn if the usual chemotherapy given before surgery (neoadjuvant therapy) for breast cancer plus the experimental drug, atezolizumab, is better than the usual chemotherapy plus a placebo. (A placebo is a drug that looks like the study drug but contains no medication.) The usual chemotherapy in this study is paclitaxel (WP) and carboplatin followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) or epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC). Usually, after neoadjuvant therapy and surgery for triple negative breast cancer, no additional treatment is given unless the cancer returns. This study will also look at continuing treatment after surgery with atezolizumab or the placebo. To be better, atezolizumab given with the neoadjuvant therapy should be better at: 1) decreasing the amount of tumor in the breast than the placebo given with the usual chemotherapy and 2) decreasing the chance of the cancer from returning after surgery.
