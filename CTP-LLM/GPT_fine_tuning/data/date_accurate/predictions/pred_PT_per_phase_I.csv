"TRIAL NAME: Phase I - Lucile Packard Childrens Hospital; BRIEF: The application of experimental hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) therapy in sickle-cell disease (SCD) must strike a balance between the underlying disease severity and the possibility of a direct benefit of the treatment, particularly in pediatric populations. Clinical studies in adults with SCD have focused on interventions that prolong survival and improve the quality of life. Unlike children, adults with SCD are much more likely to have a debilitating complication. As a result, the risk/benefit ratio of HCT is very favorable in adults, particularly if an approach to HCT that defines an acceptable level of toxicity can be established. Whereas hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only curative treatment currently available for patients with SCD, the morbidity, the frequent irreversible damage in target organs and the mortality reported in the natural course of patients with severe SCD are strong incentives to perform HSCTs in younger age groups. For those who lack a matched related donor, CB transplant is an appealing option, but despite been less problematic, CB accessibility related to cell dose of appropriately matched cord blood unit (CBU) remains a significant issue. Through a 7-day culture process of a CBU's hematopoietic stem cell HSCs with the UM171 compound, the total cell dose is increased mitigating this limitation. UM171-CB expansion (ECT-001-CB) allows a greater CB accessibility, the selection of better matched cords that might translate into favourable clinical outcomes as reported in previous trials, including a lower risk of graft-versus-host disease. After CB selection and ex-vivo expansion, ECT-001-CB transplant will follow a myeloablative reduced-toxicity conditioning regimen consisting of rATG, busulfan and fludarabine with doses of all agents optimized to the individual using model-based dosing and will be followed by standard supportive care and GVHD prophylaxis consisting of tacrolimus and MMF. ; DRUG USED: ECT001; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Sickle Cell Anemia; TARGET: ; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: ExCellThera inc.; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: 1.

Female subjects of childbearing potential who were sexually active with a non-sterilized male partner must have used at least one highly effective method of contraception from the time of screening and must have agreed to continue using such precautions for 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab or for 6 months after the final dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab (whichever was longer). Non-sterilized male partners of a female subject must have used male condoms plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after this point should have been discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method were not acceptable methods of birth control. Female subjects should have also refrained from breastfeeding throughout the period described above. Females of childbearing potential were defined as those who were not surgically sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or post-menopausal. Females were considered post-menopausal if they had been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements applied: - Females <50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they had luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy). - Females ≥ 50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy). Non-sterilized male subjects who were sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must have used male condoms plus spermicide from screening through 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab or through 6 months after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab (whichever was longer). Female partners (of childbearing potential) of a male subject must have used a highly effective method of contraception throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after this point should have been discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method were not acceptable methods of contraception. Male subjects should have refrained from sperm donation throughout the period described above. A highly effective method of contraception was defined as one that resulted in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Note that some contraception methods were not considered highly effective (e.g., male or female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen-only oral hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action [excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which was considered highly effective]; and triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills). 17. Any condition that, in the clinical judgment of the treating physician, was likely to prevent the subject from complying with any aspect of the protocol or that may have put the subject at unacceptable risk. 18. Subjects must not have donated blood while on study and for at least 90 days following the last durvalumab treatment or 6 months after the last tremelimumab treatment, whichever was longer. ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: Number of Subjects With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs); SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: Number of Subjects With Best Overall Immune-related Tumor Response",Yes,No

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I - TACTAL; BRIEF: Patients have a type of lymph gland disease called Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma which has come back, or may come back, or has not gone away after treatment, including the standard treatment known for these diseases. This a research study using special immune system cells called tumor associated antigen (TAA)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, a new experimental therapy. This sort of therapy has been used previously to treat Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphomas that show proof of infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the virus that causes infectious mononucleosis (""mono"" or the ""kissing disease""). EBV is found in cancer cells of up to half of all patients with Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This suggests that it may play a role in causing lymphoma. The cancer cells infected by EBV are able to hide from the body's immune system and escape being killed. Investigators tested whether special white blood cells, called T cells, that were trained to kill EBV-infected cells could affect these tumors, and in many patients it was found that giving these trained T cells caused a complete or partial response. However, many patients do not have EBV in their lymphoma cells; therefore investigators now want to test whether it is possible to direct these special T cells against other types of proteins on the tumor cell surface with similar promising results. The proteins that will be targeted in this study are called tumor associated antigens (TAAs) - these are cell proteins that are specific to the cancer cell, so they either do not show or show up in low quantities on normal human cells. In this study, we will target five TAAs which commonly show on lymphoma, called: NY-ESO-1, MAGEA4, PRAME, Survivin and SSX. This will be done by using special types of T cells called cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) generated in the lab. In addition, some adult patients will receive a drug called azacytidine before giving the T cells. We hope that the combination helps the T cells work better. ; DRUG USED: MT-401; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Hematologic Cancer; TARGET: Melanoma antigen-encoding gene (MAGE), NY-ESO-1 (Cancer-testis antigen), PRAME/MAPE/OIP4, Stem Cells/Other Cell Therapies, Survivin, Synovial Sarcoma X (SSX) Breakpoint Family, T lymphocytes; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Baylor College of Medicine; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: PROCUREMENT: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I - 21-0002; BRIEF: This is a phase 1, open-label, randomized clinical trial in males and non-pregnant females, 18 years of age and older, who are in good health, have no known history of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 infection, and meet all other eligibility criteria. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273.351 manufactured by ModernaTX, Inc, given in vaccination schedules alone, sequentially, or coadministered with mRNA-1273. mRNA-1273.351 is a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes for a full-length, prefusion stabilized S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant. Enrollment will occur at approximately five domestic clinical research sites. This study includes two cohorts. Cohort 1 will provide rapid information about the immunogenicity of mRNA-1273.351 in a previously vaccinated group. This cohort can inform near term public health decisions if the variant virus becomes more widespread. Cohort 2 will evaluate different strategies for generation of cross protective immune responses in a naïve population. This cohort will take longer to provide information on the immunogenicity of mRNA-1273.351, but is important to inform future public health strategies. Cohort 1 will include approximately 60 subjects 18 years of age and older who received two vaccinations of mRNA-1273 at dosages of 50 mcg, 100 mcg, or 250 mcg in the Phase 1 clinical trial (DMID 20-0003). Subjects in Cohort 1 will receive a single intramuscular (IM) injection of the designated vaccine and will be followed through 12 months after vaccination. Follow-up visits will occur on Days 8, 15, and 29, as well as 3, 6, and 12 months after the vaccination. Cohort 2 will include approximately 150 participants 18 through 55 years of age who have not received a COVID-19 vaccine, have no known history of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 infection, and do not have underlying conditions that are associated with an increased risk of severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Enrollment may close before the full 150 participants based on estimates on the timing of immunogenicity results and the need to inform public health decisions. They will be randomly assigned to one of 8 treatment arms and will receive 2 or 3 IM injections of the vaccine and followed through 12 months after the last vaccination. Follow-up visits will occur 7, 14, and 28 days after each vaccination, as well as 3, 6 and 12 months post the last vaccination. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351 vaccines, in naïve and previously vaccinated individuals. ; DRUG USED: mRNA-1273; DRUG CLASS: Vaccine; INDICATION: COVID-19 Prevention; TARGET: Immune System, SARS-CoV-2; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID); CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase II - w/Carboplatin/Gemcitabine; BRIEF: This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of gemcitabine hydrochloride and berzosertib when given together with carboplatin in treating patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that has come back (recurrent) and has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Chemotherapy drugs, such as carboplatin and gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Berzosertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving berzosertib with chemotherapy (carboplatin and gemcitabine hydrochloride) may work better in treating patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer compared to chemotherapy alone. ; DRUG USED: M6620; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Ovarian Cancer; TARGET: Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related Protein (ATR)/Frap-related Protein 1 (FRP1); THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: National Cancer Institute (NCI); CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Histologically confirmed high grade serous or endometrioid ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube malignancy that is metastatic and for which curative measures do not exist. The histology can be confirmed from tissue that was taken at the time of diagnosis. A biopsy at the time of recurrence prior to enrollment on study is not required - Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as >= 20 mm (>= 2 cm) with conventional techniques or as >= 10 mm (>= 1 cm) with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or calipers by clinical exam - Patients enrolled in the expansion cohort will be required to have archival tumor tissue available for analysis and be willing to have a tumor biopsy at baseline (after registration and prior to starting study treatment), at cycle 1 day 2 and at cycle 2 day 2. Patients must have platinum sensitive disease and be in their first or second platinum sensitive recurrence. Platinum sensitive disease is defined as recurrence that occurred greater than six months after completion of their last line of platinum based therapy. No non-platinum regimens allowed; prior therapy with PARP inhibitors as well as bevacizumab is allowed - No more than two prior platinum based regimens. One regimen is defined as the interval of treatment from start of platinum based doublet to finish of that treatment course for the initial therapy or for the recurrent disease episode. If the nonplatinum agent is altered due to any reason other than disease progression, it counts as one regimen. For example, if a patient started on carboplatin and paclitaxel but developed a taxol reaction and was switched to carboplatin and Abraxane, this counts as one prior regimen - Children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =< 2 (Karnofsky >= 60%) - Life expectancy of greater than 6 months - Leukocytes >= 3,000/mcL - Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1,500/mcL - Platelets >= 100,000/mcL - Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits - Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =< 2 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) - Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance >= 50 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal - Negative serum pregnancy test result for females of child bearing potential - Note: The effects of M6620 (VX-970) on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-damage response (DDR) inhibitors as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial may have teratogenic potential, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and 6 months after completion of M6620 (VX-970) administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately - Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Exclusion Criteria: - Patients with platinum resistant disease or platinum sensitive disease that is past the first or second recurrence - Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier, excluding alopecia. Patients with treatment related effects, such as peripheral neuropathy, that are grade 1 or less are eligible - Prior exposure to gemcitabine - Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents - Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events - History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to M6620 (VX-970), carboplatin, gemcitabine or to these specific compounds - M6620 (VX-970) is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4; therefore, concomitant administration with strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference for a list of drugs to avoid or minimize use of. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product - Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements - Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M6620 (VX-970) as a DNA-damage response (DDR) inhibitor may have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with M6620 (VX-970), breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with M6620 (VX-970). These potential risks also apply to the other agents used in this study, such as carboplatin and gemcitabine - Patients with Li Fraumeni syndrome are excluded from the study as M6620 (VX-970) is a DDR inhibitor - Addition of bevacizumab to the treatment in this study is not allowed; if the treating physician feels that the addition of bevacizumab is in the best interest of the patient, the patient should be treated with an FDA approved regimen outside of the present study ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (phase I dose escalation); SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: Confirmed response rate",No,No

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I - 04409 (UPenn); BRIEF: This is a Pilot/Phase I, single arm, single center, open label study to determine the safety, efficacy and cellular kinetics of CART19 (CTL019) in chemotherapy resistant or refractory CD19+ leukemia and lymphoma subjects. The study consists of three Phases: 1) a Screening Phase, followed by 2) an Intervention/Treatment Phase consisting of apheresis, lymphodepleting chemotherapy (determined by the Investigator and based on subject's disease burden and histology, as well as on the prior chemotherapy history received), infusions of CTL019, tumor collection by bone marrow aspiration or lymph node biopsy (optional, depending on availability), and 3) a Follow-up Phase. The suitability of subjects' T cells for CTL019 manufacturing was determined at study entry. Subjects with adequate T cells were leukapheresed to obtain large numbers of peripheral blood mononuclear cells for CTL019 manufacturing. The T cells were purified from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells, transduced with TCR-ζ/4-1BB lentiviral vector, expanded in vitro and then frozen for future administration. The number of subjects who had inadequate T cell collections, expansion or manufacturing compared to the number of subjects who had T cells successfully manufactured is a primary measure of feasibility of this study. Unless contraindicated and medically not advisable based on previous chemotherapy, subjects were given conditioning chemotherapy prior to CTL019 infusion. The chemotherapy was completed 1 to 4 days before the planned infusion of the first dose of CTL019. Up to 20 evaluable subjects with CD19+ leukemia or lymphoma were planned to be dosed with CTL019. A single dose of CTL019 (consisting of approximately 5x10^9 total cells, with a minimal acceptable dose for infusion of 1.5x10^7 CTL019 cells) was to be given to subjects as fractions (10%, 30% and 60% of the total dose) on Day 0, 1 and 2. A second 100% dose of CTL019 was initially permitted to be given on Day 11 to 14 to subjects, providing they had adequate tolerance to the first dose and sufficient CTL019 was manufactured. ; DRUG USED: Kymriah; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL); TARGET: Autologous Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells (CAR-T), Cluster of Differentiation 19 (CD19), Immune System, Stem Cells/Other Cell Therapies, T lymphocytes; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: University of Pennsylvania; CRITERIA: Inclusion - Male and female subjects with CD19+ B cell malignancies in patients with no available curative treatment options (such as autologous or allogeneic SCT) who have limited prognosis (several months to < 2 year survival) with currently available therapies will be enrolled - CD19+ leukemia or lymphoma - ALL in CR2 or CR3 and not eligible for allogeneic SCT because of age, comorbid disease, or lack of available family member or unrelated donor - Follicular lymphoma, previously identified as CD19+: - At least 2 prior combination chemotherapy regimens (not including single agent monoclonal antibody (Rituxan) therapy - Stage III-IV disease - Less than 1 year between last chemotherapy and progression (i.e. most recent progression free interval < 1 year) - Disease responding or stable after most recent therapy (chemotherapy, MoAb, etc) - CLL: - At least 2 prior chemotherapy regimens (not including single agent monoclonal antibody (Rituxan) therapy.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I - GD2+ Solid Tumors; BRIEF: Background GD2 is a well-characterized tumor antigen in neuroblastoma, which is also expressed on osteosarcomas and some other sarcomas. T cells expressing 1st generation anti-GD2 chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) were safe and mediated modest antitumor activity in some patients with refractory neuroblastoma. A 3rd generation anti-GD2-CAR (GD2-CAR.OX40.28.z.ICD9) has been produced and holds promise for increased activity compared to the 1st generation GD2-CAR already studied in clinical trials. As an added safety measure, the vector includes a suicide switch comprising a caspase dimerization domain (ICD9) that can be activated by a small molecule to induce death of the genetically engineered cells if they were induce untoward toxicity. Objectives Primary:Determine the feasibility of producing anti GD2-CAR cells meeting the established release criteria and to assess the safety of administering escalating doses of anti-GD2-CAR engineered T cells in children and young adults with GD2+ solid tumors, including neuroblastoma, following cyclophosphamide-based lymphodepletion. Secondary: 1. Determine if administration anti-GD2-CAR engineered T cells mediate antitumor effects in children and young adults with GD2+ solid tumors; 2. Measure persistence of adoptively transferred anti-GD2-CAR T cells and correlate this with antitumor effects; 3. Extend information regarding the prevalence and intensity of GD2 expression in non-neuroblastoma, non-osteosarcoma solid tumors in children and young adults; 4. If unacceptable toxicity occurs that is possibly, probably or likely related to anti-GD2-CAR T cells, assess the capacity for AP1903, a dimerizing agent, to mediate clearance of the genetically engineered cells and resolve toxicity; and 5. Assess toxicity of AP1903 if administered to mediate clearance of anti-GD2-CAR T cells. Eligibility Patients 1-35 years of age, at least 15 kg, with osteosarcoma or a GD2+ solid tumor (including neuroblastoma) that has recurred after or not responded to standard therapy and is deemed incurable by standard therapy. Design After apheresis to collect T cells for transduction, patients receive cyclophosphamide 1800mg/m(2)/d as a lymphodepleting regimen. A phase I cell dose escalation scheme will used at 4 dose levels (1 x 10(5) transduced T cells/kg; 1 x 10(6) transduced T cells/kg; 3 x 10(6) transduced T cells/kg; and 1 x 10(7) transduced T cells/kg), using a standard 3 plus 3 dose escalation design. An expanded group of a total of 12 patients will be treated at the highest dose, comprising at least 6 osteosarcoma patients. Patients will be monitored for toxicity, antitumor effects and persistence of anti-GD2-CAR T cells. Patients with a PR, SD may receive a 2nd cycle at the next higher dose level a minimum of 60 days following completion of the first cycle if eligibility criteria are met. A maximum of 36 patients may be treated on this study. Given that there is likelihood that some patients with non-osteosarcoma will not meet the criteria for GD2 expression to be eligible for enrollment, up to 72 subjects will be screened to enroll a maximum of 36 patients for treatment. Up to 2-3 patients will be accrued per month, and therefore this study may require up to 2-3 years to complete enrollment and treatment. ; DRUG USED: Anti-GD2-CAR engineered T cells; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Solid Tumors; TARGET: Autologous Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells (CAR-T), Ganglioside GD2, Immune System, Stem Cells/Other Cell Therapies, T lymphocytes; THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: National Cancer Institute (NCI); CRITERIA: - INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I - MAD; BRIEF: RBN-2397 inhibits PARP7, an enzyme that is switched on by cancer stresses, such as the toxins in cigarette smoke. Cancer cells use PARP7 to hide from the immune system by stopping the cell from sending a signal (Type 1 interferon) that tells the immune system that something is wrong and to kill the cell. RBN-2397 has been shown in animal studies to inhibit tumor growth and also shuts down the ""don't kill me"" signal the tumor is sending to evade the immune system. As a PARP7 inhibitor RBN-2397 is different from drugs inhibiting PARP1, PARP2 and PARP3 enzymes which are approved for the treatment of certain ovarian and breast cancers. The primary purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of orally administered RBN-2397 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of RBN-2397, examine the pharmacokinetics (PK) (measure how the body absorbs, breaks down and eliminates RBN-2397) and investigate whether it has antitumor activity in solid tumor cancers. ; DRUG USED: RBN-2397; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Solid Tumors; TARGET: Poly ADP-Ribose Polymerase (PARP); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Ribon Therapeutics, Inc.; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: Dose Escalation Phase only: Metastatic or advanced-stage solid malignant tumor (which may include ""solid"" lymphoma [e.g., mantle cell]) for whom no therapy exists that would be curative or might provide clinical benefit.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase Ia - Advanced Solid Tumors; BRIEF: Study HC-404-FCP-2011 is a first in human, Phase 1a, multi-center, open-label study to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral dosing of HC-5404-FU in a dose-escalating fashion. Up to 36 qualified subjects at 3 to 5 US sites, who have specific tumor types of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), gastric cancer (GC), metastatic breast cancer (MBC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and other solid tumors (e.g., non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, carcinoma of unknown primary) with the exception of rapidly progressing neoplasms (e.g., pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma) will receive HC-5404-FU. Every effort will be made to ensure approximately 50% of all subjects enrolled will be subjects with RCC and GC. The starting dose level is 25 mg twice daily (BID), escalating to 50, 100, and 200 mg BID as safety allows, following the Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design. The safety monitoring committee (SMC) will evaluate the DLTs and cumulative safety and PK data at the end of each cohort. Based on the SMC recommendations after a comprehensive review of PK and safety data for 200 mg BID dose, higher dose levels will be evaluated, starting with 400 mg BID. The dose will escalate to 600 mg and then 900 mg following the BOIN design starting with 1 subject at each escalated dose, until the MTD is reached or the sponsor or SMC declares the dose most appropriate for clinical development. This Phase 1a will be expanded into a Phase 1b/2a study through a protocol amendment and will then assess the dose and tumor type(s) selected in Phase 1a as the most appropriate for further clinical development. Subjects will be dosed until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression per immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST), subject withdrawal, any other administrative reasons, or after 2 years of treatment, whichever occurs first. Efficacy will be assessed via Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1); computed tomography (CT) scans will be conducted every 6 weeks. Safety, including occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), pharmacokinetics (PK), and biomarker parameters will also be assessed. ; DRUG USED: HC-5404-FU; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Solid Tumors; TARGET: Protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK); THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: HiberCell, Inc.; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I - Safety; BRIEF: Myelofibrosis (MF) is a bone marrow illness that affects blood-forming tissues in the body. MF disturbs the body's normal production of blood cells, causing extensive scarring in the bone marrow. This leads to severe anemia, weakness, fatigue, and an enlarged spleen. The purpose of this study is to see how safe and tolerable mivebresib is, when given alone, and in combination with navitoclax or ruxolitinib, for adult participants with MF. Mivebresib is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of MF. The study has 4 segments - A, B, C, and D. In Segment A, the safe dosing regimen of mivebresib is identified, and then given alone as monotherapy. In Segment B, C, and D, combination therapies of mivebresib with either ruxolitinib or navitoclax are given. Adult participants with a diagnosis of MF will be enrolled. Around 130 participants will be enrolled in 60 sites worldwide. In Segment A, participants will receive different doses and schedules of oral mivebresib tablet to identify a safe dosing regimen. Additional participants will be enrolled at the identified monotherapy dosing regimen. In Segment B, participants will receive oral ruxolitinib and mivebresib will be given as ""add-on"" therapy.

Patients lymphoma has come back or not gone away after treatment. Because there is no standard treatment for the patients cancer at this time or because the currently used treatments do not work fully in all cases, the patients are being asked to volunteer in this research study. In this study the investigators want to test a type of T cell made from a normal donor. The T cells the investigators will use are called Epstein Barr virus (EBV) specific T cells (EBVSTs) and are cells that the investigators have trained in the laboratory to recognize a EBV which is the virus that causes mono or kissing disease. Some patients with lymphoma have EBV in their cancer cells. Researchers have given T cell lines from normal donor EBVSTs to lymphoma patients who have EBV in their lymphoma cells and have seen responses in about half the patients. The cells have have been generated and are frozen in a bank. The cells are called ""allogeneic"" (meaning the donor is not related to the patient).

"TRIAL NAME: Phase Ib - w/BI 754091; BRIEF: This study has 2 parts. The first part was open to adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The second part was open also to adults with other types of advanced cancer of the lung, brain, skin, and liver. After early encouraging results, more people with liver cancer can now take part in the study. The participants get a combination of two medicines called BI 836880 and ezabenlimab. BI 836880 is a type of an antibody that blocks new blood vessel formation. New blood vessels are needed by the tumour to continue growing. Ezabenlimab is an antibody that may help the immune system fight cancer (immune checkpoint inhibitor). The purpose of the first part of the study was to find out the highest dose of the BI 836880 that the participants can tolerate in combination with BI 754091. After the best dose of BI 836880 for the combination with ezabenlimab was found, it is used in the second part of the study. The purpose of the second part is to see whether the combination of BI 836880 and BI 754091 is able to make tumours shrink. The participants are in the study as long as they benefit from and can tolerate treatment. During this time, they get infusions of BI 836880 and ezabenlimab every 3 weeks.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase IIb - w/Indoximod/Docetaxel; BRIEF: This is a Phase 1/2 trial using indoximod, an inhibitor of the immune ""checkpoint"" pathway indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), in combination with Tergenpumatucel-L immunotherapy and Docetaxel to treat subjects with advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). From a practical standpoint, a successful tumor immunotherapy will likely require a combination treatment with additional therapeutic interventions that both activate an immune response and remove redundant mechanisms of tolerance maintenance. This clinical trial utilizes the combination of the chemotherapeutic agent, docetaxel, plus two investigational methods of cancer immunotherapy: the first, tergenpumatucel-L, is intended to educate the human immune system to recognize the abnormal components found in lung cancer cells, resulting in an immune response intended to destroy or block the growth of the cancer; and the second, the IDO inhibitor Indoximod, will overcome tumor-induced immune suppression. The goal of this study is to assess the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates in this patient population. This study will provide a foundation for future trials testing indoximod combined with tergenpumatucel-L. ; DRUG USED: HyperAcute Lung; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC); TARGET: Immune System, Stem Cells/Other Cell Therapies; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: NewLink Genetics Corporation; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria - Histological/cytological diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I - 25/50mg Dose (Healthy Volunteers); BRIEF: In this study a known investigational medicinal product called semaglutide will be tested in four different tablet versions. In addition to semaglutide, the different tablet versions C, D, E and F contain different helping agents in different amounts. All tablet versions have a helping agent called SNAC. All tablet versions are tested for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Recently the European Medicines Agency approved semaglutide in tablet form and currently, tablets in the doses 3 mg, 7 mg and 14 mg can be prescribed in some countries. The main aim of this study is to test oral semaglutide doses of 25 mg and 50 mg. These are higher dosages of oral semaglutide than can be prescribed today. With the 50 mg dose, we expect the amount of semaglutide in the blood to be higher than what has been tested before. Further aims of this study are to find an optimal version for the semaglutide tablets, and to examine the safety and tolerability of the different tablet versions. For this purpose, the amount of semaglutide in the blood will be measured after taking different semaglutide tablets, in different doses. The version of the tablet participants will receive (i.e. the treatment arm participants will be assigned to) is decided by chance. In treatment periods 1 and 2 participants will receive one tablet daily over 2 weeks for each period. For treatment periods 3 to 5 participants will receive one tablet daily over 4 weeks for each period (participants may get 2 tablets per day in treatment period 5). This means that treatment will take 16 weeks in total. The tablets should be taken in the morning together with no more than half a glass of water (120 mL), after an overnight fast of at least 6 hours (no food or drinks). Water is also not allowed from 2 hours before dosing. After dosing participants must wait 30-35 minutes before they eat or drink. At home, participants must take their breakfast 30-45 minutes after dosing. No oral medication (which are taken by mouth) can be taken from 2 hours before and until 30 minutes after each dosing with semaglutide. The study can last for up to 24 weeks for each participant. This includes a screening period (up to 3 weeks), a treatment period (16 weeks) and a follow-up visit (5 weeks after the last dosing). Participants will have 11 clinic visits with the study doctor. Some of the visits include overnight stays. Participants will have blood tests at every visit.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I - BB-004; BRIEF: Many types of cancer are primarily treated with surgery and patient survival is directly related to the extent to which the tumor is able to be removed. It is often difficult for surgeons to distinguish tumor tissue from normal tissue or to detect tumor cells that have spread from the original tumor site, resulting in incomplete removal of the tumor and reduced patient survival. In some sites, such as the brain, it is critical to avoid damage to normal tissue around the tumor to prevent adverse effects of surgery on function. The investigators hypothesize that BLZ-100 will improve surgical outcomes by allowing surgeons to visualize the edges of the tumor and small groups of cancer cells that have spread to other sites in real-time as they operate. This is a safety study to assess the safety of BLZ-100 in pediatric patients with central nervous system tumors. ; DRUG USED: BLZ-100; DRUG CLASS: Non-NME; INDICATION: Brain Cancer - Imaging; TARGET: ; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Blaze Bioscience Inc.; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I - DOTTI (Baylor College of Medicine); BRIEF: Patients will be receiving a stem cell transplant as treatment for their disease. As part of the stem cell transplant, patients will be given very strong doses of chemotherapy, which will kill all their existing stem cells. A close relative of the patient will be identified, whose stem cells are not a perfect match for the patient's, but can be used. This type of transplant is called ""allogeneic"", meaning that the cells are from a donor. With this type of donor who is not a perfect match, there is typically an increased risk of developing GvHD, and a longer delay in the recovery of the immune system. GvHD is a serious and sometimes fatal side-effect of stem cell transplant. GvHD occurs when the new donor cells (graft) recognize that the body tissues of the patient (host) are different from those of the donor. In this study, investigators are trying to see whether they can make special T cells in the laboratory that can be given to the patient to help their immune system recover faster. As a safety measure, we want to ""program"" the T cells so that if, after they have been given to the patient, they start to cause GvHD, we can destroy them (""suicide gene""). Investigators will obtain T cells from a donor, culture them in the laboratory, and then introduce the ""suicide gene"" which makes the cells sensitive to a specific drug called AP1903. If the specially modified T cells begin to cause GvHD, the investigators can kill the cells by administering AP1903 to the patient. We have had encouraging results in a previous study regarding the effective elimination of T cells causing GvHD, while sparing a sufficient number of T cells to fight infection and potentially cancer. More specifically, T cells made to carry a gene called iCasp9 can be killed when they encounter the drug AP1903. To get the iCasp9 gene into T cells, we insert it using a virus called a retrovirus that has been made for this study. The AP1903 that will be used to ""activate"" the iCasp9 is an experimental drug that has been tested in a study in normal donors with no bad side-effects. We hope we can use this drug to kill the T cells. The major purpose of this study is to find a safe and effective dose of ""iCasp9"" T cells that can be given to patients who receive an allogeneic stem cell transplant. Another important purpose of this study is to find out whether these special T cells can help the patient's immune system recover faster after the transplant than they would have otherwise. ; DRUG USED: Rivo-cel; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplant - Graft vs. Host Disease (GVHD) Prophylaxis; TARGET: Caspases, Stem Cells/Other Cell Therapies, T-Cell Receptor (TCR); THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: Baylor College of Medicine; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: Inclusion Criteria at Time of Procurement: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I - SCD; BRIEF: A promising approach for the treatment of genetic diseases is called gene therapy. Gene therapy is a relatively new field of medicine that uses genetic material (mostly DNA) from the patient to treat his or her own disease. In gene therapy, the investigators introduce new genetic material in order to fix or replace the patient's disease gene, with the goal of curing the disease. The procedure is similar to a bone marrow transplant, in that the patient's malfunctioning blood stem cells are reduced or eliminated using chemotherapy, but it is different because instead of using a different person's (donor) blood stem cells for the transplant, the patient's own blood stem cells are given back after the new genetic material has been introduced into those cells. This approach has the advantage of eliminating any risk of GVHD, reducing the risk of graft rejection, and may also allow less chemotherapy to be utilized for the conditioning portion of the transplant procedure. The method used to introduce the gene into the patient's own blood stem cells is to engineer and use a modified version of a virus (called a 'vector') that efficiently inserts the ""correcting"" genetic material into the cells. The vector is a specialized biological medicine that has been formulated for use in human beings. The investigators have recently discovered a gene that is very important in the control of fetal hemoglobin expression. Increasing the expression of this gene in sickle cell patients could increase the amount of fetal hemoglobin while simultaneously reducing the amount of sickle hemoglobin in their blood, and therefore potentially cure the condition. In summary, the advantages of a gene therapy approach include: 1) it can be used even if the patient does not have a matched donor available; 2) it may allow a reduction in the amount of chemotherapy required to prepare the patient for the transplant; and 3) it will avoid the strong medicines often required to prevent and treat GVHD and rejection. The goal is to test whether this approach is safe, and whether using gene therapy to change the expression of this particular gene will lead to increased fetal hemoglobin production in people with sickle cell disease. ; DRUG USED: BCL11a shRNA(miR); DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Sickle Cell Anemia; TARGET: BCL11A, Stem Cells/Other Cell Therapies; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: David Williams; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Diagnosis of SCD with genotype HbSS, HbS/0 thalassemia, HbSD, or HbSO - Severe symptomatic SCD, defined by the presence of one or more of the following clinical complications: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I - w/WBRT; BRIEF: This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of berzosertib (M6620 [VX-970]) when given together with whole brain radiation therapy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, or neuroendocrine tumors that have spread from the original (primary) tumor to the brain (brain metastases). Berzosertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving berzosertib together with radiation therapy may work better compared to standard of care treatment, including brain surgery and radiation therapy, in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, or neuroendocrine tumors. ; DRUG USED: M6620; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC); TARGET: Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related Protein (ATR)/Frap-related Protein 1 (FRP1); THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: National Cancer Institute (NCI); CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including neuroendocrine tumors or small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who are being evaluated for palliative WBRT (with or without neurosurgical resection or stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS]) for radiologically or histologically diagnosed brain metastases presumed to be from the lung cancer are eligible for this Phase I study. Group 2 will only include NSCLC patients. - Life expectance of greater than two months to allow completion of study treatment and assessment of dose-limiting toxicity - Group 2 patients should have archived or fresh tumor tissue available from the non-craniotomy site and will have fresh tumor tissue available from the planned craniotomy - Age >= 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) in patients < 18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials. - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =< 2 (Karnofsky >= 60%) - Note: though patients with ECOG performance status of 3 due to neurological deficits who are otherwise fit to receive systemic therapy per clinician assessments will be allowed - Leukocytes >= 3,000/mcL - Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1,500/mcL - Platelets >= 100,000/mcL - If no known liver metastases: total bilirubin < 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN); if known liver metastases, then: total bilirubin < 2.5 x ULN - If no known liver metastases: aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) < 2 x ULN; if known liver metastases, then: AST/SGOT of ALT/SGPT < 5 x ULN - Creatinine within normal institutional limits for age OR creatinine clearance >= 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above ULN - Negative serum or urine pregnancy test result for females of child bearing potential - The effects of M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because radiation therapy is known to have teratogenic potential, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 6 months after completion of M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) administration. - Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Exclusion Criteria: - Patients with 1-3 brain metastases, each < 3 cm by contrast MRI, with stable systemic disease and ECOG score of 0-2, who would otherwise be eligible for SRS/stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) alone should not be enrolled into this study unless WBRT is recommended due to any medical reasons or logistic limitations as determined by the treating physician. Patients who develop recurrence post-SRS/SRT or surgery alone and are recommended WBRT will be eligible for the protocol. - Greater than 1 cm mid-line shift, severe uncal herniation or significant hemorrhage/hydrocephalus (intra-lesional hemorrhage is acceptable). Patients with seizure at presentation who have been started on levetiracetam and have been stable for 48 hours prior to study registration are eligible at the discretion of treating physician - Patients who have received systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or, immunotherapy or other intravenous standard therapy for 2 weeks before initiation of planned WBRT, for oral targeted agents 3-7 days per clinician discretion or patients who have not recovered to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 2 or less from serious (CTCAE grade 3 or more) adverse events form the previously received agents. For any other investigational agents, at least 4 half-lives of the agent (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) should have elapsed prior to starting study treatment - Patients must not have received prior WBRT (previous SRS/SRT done at least 2 weeks from the planned start of WBRT is acceptable). Patients planned upfront to undergo SRS/SRT/fractionated boosts or neurosurgery after WBRT are not eligible; however, these treatments/procedures can be performed once the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment has been completed, if felt clinically necessary - Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) as a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-damage response (DDR) inhibitor may have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Further, radiation therapy is known to have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib), breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib). - History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib). - M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4); therefore, concomitant administration with strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference for a list of drugs to avoid or minimize use of. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product. Ongoing phenytoin should be either discontinued if clinically safe or transitioned to non-enzyme-inducing antiepileptics like levetiracetam with a 8-day washout period (half-life 18-22 hours, time to steady-state 4-8 days) prior to first dose of M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) (7-days prior to WBRT). - Patients needing more than 8 mg dexamethasone per day at the time of start of WBRT will not be eligible to participate in the study. However, patients will be allowed entry into the study if it is medically safe to reduce the daily dose of dexamethasone to 8 mg or less from the day of the start of WBRT. The dexamethasone dose for such patients may be increased beyond 8 mg per day during the course of treatment if medically necessary. This increased need for dose should be communicated to the study's principal investigator, Dr Mohindra at the University of Maryland. - Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that would increase the risk of toxicity or limit compliance with study requirements. This includes but is not limited to, ongoing uncontrolled serious infection requiring i.v. antibiotics at the time of registration, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) and the uncertainties of any impact thereof on the radiation toxicities. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated. - Patients with known diagnoses that are associated with germline DDR defects such as Li Fraumeni syndrome and ataxia telangiectasia are excluded from the study as M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) is a DDR inhibitor. ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: Number of Participants With a Dose-limiting Toxicity; SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: Incidence of Delayed Neurological Toxicity",No,No
"TRIAL NAME: Phase I/II - Symptomatic Lumbar Intervertebral Disc Degeneration (DGX-A01); BRIEF: The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and preliminary efficacy of intradiscal injections of two doses of IDCT (Discogenic Cells + Sodium Hyaluronate vehicle) and two controls (saline, Sodium Hyaluronate vehicle) in subjects with chronic low back pain due to Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD) at one lumbar level from L3 to S1. ; DRUG USED: Injectable Discogenic Cell Therapy; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Musculoskeletal Conditions; TARGET: Stem Cells/Other Cell Therapies; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: DiscGenics, Inc.; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: The subject must have: 1.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I - SAD/MAD; BRIEF: A Phase 1, double blind, sponsor open, single and multiple ascending dose study to evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of PF-07321332 in healthy participants. ; DRUG USED: PF-07321332; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: COVID-19 Treatment; TARGET: Protease, SARS-CoV-2; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Pfizer; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Healthy male or female subjects between ages of 18-60 years. Male only in part-4. - Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5kg/m2; and a total body weight >50kg (110lbs) - Japanese subjects who have four Japanese biologic grandparents born in Japan Exclusion Criteria: - Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of dosing) - Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy, cholecystectomy, intestinal resection). - Positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of screening or Day-1. - Have received COVID-19 vaccine within 7 days before screening or have received only one of the 2 required doses of COVID-19 vaccine - Use of tobacco or nicotine containing products in excess of the equivalents of 5 cigarettes per day or 2 chews of tobacco per day ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: Number of participants with Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) in single ascending dose (SAD); SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) in SAD",Yes,Yes
"TRIAL NAME: Phase I - w/ Auto-SCT; BRIEF: The primary goals: determine the safety, tolerability and engraftment potential of CART-19 T cells in patients undergoing salvage ASCT after early relapse following first ASCT. CART-19 cells transduced with a lentiviral vector to express anti-CD19 scFv TCR(zeta):41BB administered by intravenous infusion using a single infusion of 1-5x108 CART19-transduced T cells on day +2 after autologous stem cell infusion following high-dose melphalan. ; DRUG USED: Kymriah; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Multiple Myeloma (MM); TARGET: Autologous Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells (CAR-T), Cluster of Differentiation 19 (CD19), Immune System, Stem Cells/Other Cell Therapies, T lymphocytes; THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: University of Pennsylvania; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria - Subjects must have undergone a prior ASCT for MM and have progressed within 365 days of stem cell infusion. Patients who underwent syngeneic transplant (i.e., transplant from an identical twin donor) rather than autologous transplant are eligible and syngeneic transplant will be considered equivalent to ASCT for the purposes of these inclusion/exclusion criteria. Progression will be defined according to IMWG criteria for progressive disease143 (Table 4). Subjects who have undergone two prior ASCTs as part of a planned tandem ASCT consolidation regimen are eligible. Patients in whom first progression is identified between days 366 and 450 (inclusive) after ASCT will be eligible if progression is identified on their first evaluation for progression in this window and if they had not been evaluated between days 270 and 365 for progression. This clause is to account for practice patterns in which patients otherwise doing well are monitored infrequently (every 3-6 months) for relapse after they recover from their first ASCT. This will allow infrequently monitored patients to be included if progression is identified on their ""12 month follow-up evaluation"" if this appointment happens to be scheduled just outside the 365-day post-ASCT window. N.B.: There is no requirement that patients must enroll within 365 days of prior ASCT, and patients may be treated with other agents, including experimental agents, following relapse/progression after prior ASCT before enrollment on this study. - Subjects must have received as part of their initial therapy for MM, prior to first ASCT, a regimen containing either bortezomib or lenalidomide. - Subjects must have a confirmed diagnosis of active MM prior to first ASCT as defined by the IMWG criteria143, with the exception that patients treated for active MM on account of recurrent, complicated infections as the only clinical manifestation or on account of progressive smoldering MM with imminent clinical complications may be included. Subjects must have signed written, informed consent. Subjects must be ≥ 18 and <70 years of age. Subjects must have an anticipated survival of >100 days after high-dose melphalan. -Subjects must have adequate vital organ function as defined by the following criteria: Serum creatinine ≤ 2.5 or estimated creatinine clearance ≥30 ml/min and not dialysis-dependent. Absolute neutrophil count ≥1000/μl and platelet count ≥50,000/μl. SGOT ≤ 3x the upper limit of normal and total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dl (except for patients in whom hyperbilirubinemia is attributed to Gilbert's syndrome). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 45% Adequate pulmonary function with FEV1, FVC, TLC, DLCO (after appropriate adjustment for lung volume and hemoglobin concentration) ≥40% of predicted values. Toxicities from prior therapies must have recovered to grade ≤2 according to the CTC 4.0 criteria or to the subject's prior baseline. - Subjects must have an ECOG performance status of 0-2, unless a higher performance status is due solely to bone pain. - Subjects must be willing to comply with the requirements of the RevAssist program if maintenance lenalidomide is planned. - Subjects must have measurable disease on study entry. Measurable disease may include quantifiable or detectable levels of serum or urine paraprotein. For patients with minimally secretory disease or non-secretory myeloma on study entry, serum free lambda or kappa light chain levels or the serum free light chain ratio may be measured and used for disease monitoring if abnormal. Likewise, for patients with IgA MM in which serum protein electrophoresis is deemed unreliable due to co-migration of normal serum proteins with the paraprotein, elevated total serum IgA levels may be considered measurable disease. - Subjects must have stored in usable condition for second ASCT, as judged by the principal investigator, ≥3x106 CD34+ cells per kg of body weight (either autologous or syngeneic) stored in at least two bags such that after administration of the minimum dose of 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg required on this protocol that a separate aliquot of at least 1 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg remains for rescue infusion in the event of graft failure. Patients with inadequate stem cells stored may still sign consent and undergo a mobilization/collection procedure either before or after apheresis for T cell harvest. If this is required and is undertaken prior to apheresis for T cell harvest, two weeks must elapse between the last day of stem cell collection and apheresis for T cell harvest. Table 5 IMWG Criteria for Progression One or more of the following criteria must be met: Increase of ≥25% from baseline in Serum M-component (the absolute increase must be ≥0.5 g/dl) (if baseline M-component is ≥5 g/dl, increases of ≥1 g/dl are sufficient to define progression) and/or Urine M-component (the absolute increase must be X200 mg/24 h ) and/or The difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels (only in patients without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels) (the absolute increase must be >10 mg/dl). Bone marrow plasma cell percentage (the absolute % must be ≥10%) For cases of IgA MM in which SPEPs are unavailable or are deemed unreliable due to migration of the paraprotein in the beta region, total IgA levels may be used to assess progression and response to therapy. Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas. Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium >11.5 mg/dl or 2.65 mmol/l) that can be attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder IMWG Criteria for Diagnosis of Multiple Myeloma Presence of an M-component in serum and/or urine plus clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow and/or a documented clonal plasmacytoma. In patients with no detectable M-component, an abnormal serum FLC ratio on the serum FLC assay can substitute and satisfy this criterion. For patients, with no serum or urine M-component and normal serum FLC ratio, the baseline bone marrow must have ≥10% clonal plasma cells; these patients are referred to as having 'non-secretory myeloma'. Patients with biopsy-proven amyloidosis and/or systemic light chain deposition disease (LCDD) should be classified as 'myeloma with documented amyloidosis' or 'myeloma with documented LCDD,' respectively if they have ≥30% plasma cells and/or myeloma-related bone disease. PLUS one or more of the following, which must be attributable to the underlying plasma cell disorder: Calcium elevation (>11.5 mg/dl) Renal insufficiency (creatinine >2 mg/dl) Anemia (hemoglobin <10 g/dl or at 2 g/dl below normal) Bone disease (lytic lesions or osteopenia) Exclusion Criteria Subjects must not: - Be pregnant or lactating. - Have inadequate venous access for or contraindications to leukapheresis. - Have any active and uncontrolled infection. - Have active or chronic hepatitis B [detectable hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)], hepatitis C [positive serology (HCV Ab)], or HIV infection. - Any uncontrolled medical disorder that would preclude participation as outlined. - Have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation. - Have received prior gene therapy or gene-modified cellular immunotherapy. Subject may have received, however, non-gene-modified autologous T-cells with their first ASCT in association with an anti-myeloma vaccine (e.g., hTERT or MAGEA3) or vaccination against infectious agents (e.g., influenza or pneumococcus) as was performed on our previous studies. - Have undergone two prior ASCTs if the second ASCT was a salvage ASCT (defined as a second ASCT performed upon progression following first ASCT) rather than a second ASCT as part of a tandem ASCT consolidation regimen. - Have auto-immune disease (including connective tissue disease, uveitis, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, or multiple sclerosis) that is active and severe in the judgment of the principal investigator, or have a history of autoimmune disease that has required prolonged immunosuppressive therapy in the judgment of the principal investigator. - Have active central nervous system disease, including CNS involvement by malignancy or evidence of blood in the CNS such as subdural hematoma. If a subject has any neurological abnormality on examination, a baseline brain MRI is required to exclude structural disease and/or intracranial bleeding. Patients with clinically significant intracranial lesions should be excluded. Patients with common age-related changes that are not clinically significant (i.e. moderate small vessel ischemic changes) do not need to be excluded. - Have a Class III/IV cardiovascular disability according to the New York Heart Association Classification ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: Number of Adverse Events; SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: ",No,No

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I - w/Temozolomide; BRIEF: The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a new investigational drug (TPI 287) for neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma both alone and in combination with temozolomide (a currently approved drug). An investigational drug is one that has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. This investigational drug is called TPI 287. This study will look at the safety and tolerability of TPI 287 both alone and in combination with temozolomide, and look to establish a safe dose of this agent. The study will also look at the tumor's response to these drugs, but this is not the primary objective of this study. TPI 287 was shown to be effective in stopping tumor growth and was also shown to be safe in three different animal species. TPI 287 has been tested in humans in four clinical trials, and approximately 100 subjects with various types of cancers have received the drug. All of these subjects that have received TPI 287 have been adults. TPI 287 has not been tested in a pediatric population before this study. Temozolomide was tested in recurrent neuroblastoma and showed activity in a recently published study. Preclinical studies of TPI in combination with temozolomide have shown at minimum an additive effect. The ability of temozolomide and TPI 287 to be effective in combination is suggested by these two drugs showing even greater activity when used together. ; DRUG USED: TPI-287; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Neuroendocrine Tumors (NET); TARGET: Microtubules (Tubulin); THERAPY: Monotherapy and Combo Therapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Giselle Sholler; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Patients must have histologically proven neuroblastoma and confirmation of refractory or recurrent disease or medulloblastoma with histologic confirmation at diagnosis or at the time of recurrence/progression - Patients must be age >12 months and diagnosed before the age of 21 - Life expectancy must be more than 3 months - If measurable disease, this must be demonstrated by residual abnormal tissue at a primary or metastatic site measuring more than 1 cm in any dimension by standardized imaging (CT or MRI).

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I/II - Biodistribution and Antitumor Activity; BRIEF: This study was conducted to advance new treatment for patients with metastatic or locally advanced cancers expressing Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1). This study was the first time the investigational drug called 177Lu-3BP-227 was administered to patients under controlled conditions of a clinical study. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how safe the investigational drug is as well to verify how well it is tolerated by patients after several intravenous administrations. In addition, the effect of the study drug on tumoral lesions and how it distributes throughout the body and at which rate it is removed from the body was evaluated. Since 177Lu-3BP-227 is a radio-labelled drug, it also measured how the emitted radiation is distributed throughout the body (dosimetry). The study consisted of a phase I dose escalation part. The study originally planned to include a phase II study however due to early termination (not due to safety concerns) the study did not progress to phase II and was stopped during phase I. For the phase I dose escalation part, it was anticipated that approximately 30 subjects will be included, in up to six escalation steps.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase Ib - NCI; BRIEF: Background: - Pazopanib is an anticancer drug that blocks the growth of new blood vessels in tumors. It has been approved to treat renal cell cancer and soft tissue sarcomas in patients who have received prior chemotherapy. ARQ 197 (Tivantinib) is an experimental drug that blocks a protein called mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET), which cancer cells need to grow. Studies suggest that some drugs that block blood vessel growth can increase the production of c-MET in tumors, which helps cancer cells keep growing. Blocking both blood vessel growth and c-MET with pazopanib and ARQ 197 may help kill cancer cells faster. This study will use these drugs to treat solid tumors that have not responded to earlier treatments. Objectives: - To test the safety and effectiveness of pazopanib and ARQ 197 for advanced solid tumors. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced solid tumors that have not responded to earlier treatments. Design: - Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also have blood and urine tests, and imaging studies. - The study drugs will be given in 4-week cycles of treatment. Participants will take pazopanib once a day and ARQ 197 twice a day by mouth. Some participants will start with pazopanib or ARQ 197 alone for the first week. Then they will take both drugs together for the rest of the study. - Participants will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies. Optional tumor samples may be collected during different treatment cycles. ; DRUG USED: Tivantinib; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Sarcoma; TARGET: Hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met, HGFR); THERAPY: Combination; LEAD SPONSOR: National Cancer Institute (NCI); CRITERIA: - ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: - Patients with histologically confirmed (by the Laboratory of Pathology, National Institutes of Health (NIH) solid tumors that have progressed following at least one line of standard therapy or for whom no standard treatment options exist. - Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease. - Patients enrolling in the expansion cohorts must have disease amenable to biopsy, and be willing to undergo pre-and post-treatment biopsies. - Patients must have completed any chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or biologic therapy greater than or equal to 4 weeks prior to entering the study (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C).

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I - FOCUS Bright (Texas Heart Institute); BRIEF: Recent studies have suggested that it may be possible to grow new blood vessels (angiogenesis) to supply the heart muscle that is currently not getting enough blood. One theory is that a certain type of stem cell, aldehyde dehydrogenase bright stem cells, may stimulate the growth of new vessels. After a bone marrow procedure, the special cells are separated and then injected back into the heart around the area of damage with a special guidance and injection system. Once a patient meets all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria, he/she will be consented to the study and extensive baseline testing will be completed at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital in Houston, Texas. Once all baseline criteria are met, the patient has his/her own bone marrow harvested and later injected, if randomized to receive active treatment. The day after the bone marrow harvest, the patient is taken to the cardiac catheterization lab where NOGA mapping is performed and the processed cells or placebo are injected under electromechanical guidance into the affected areas of the left ventricle. The patient is usually discharged home the next day and returns for follow-up at weeks 1 and 4, and months 3 and 6, and at one year unless there is a crossover and then he/she begins baseline again at 6 months and follow-up for one more year. Follow-up testing, including quality of life and NOGA mapping, is done at the time of injection, as well as at 6 months. ; DRUG USED: ALD-201; DRUG CLASS: Biologic; INDICATION: Coronary Artery Disease; TARGET: Stem Cells/Other Cell Therapies; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: Texas Heart Institute; CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria: - Canadian cardiovascular (CV) Class II-IV angina and/or congestive heart failure (CHF) symptoms - Ejection fraction less than or equal to 45% - Reversible perfusion defect on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) - Coronary artery disease (CAD) unable to be corrected by surgery (bypass) or intervention (stent) - Able to walk on treadmill - Hemodynamically stable Exclusion Criteria: - Age less than 18 or greater than 70 - Atrial fibrillation - Severe valve disease - History of cancer in last 5 years - HIV positive; hepatitis B or C positive. - Left ventricular wall thickness less than 8 mm - Recent heart attack within the last 30 days ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: Safety of Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Bright Stem Cells Versus the Control Group as Measured by Combined Early and Late Adverse Events; SECONDARY OUTCOME 1: New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification",No,No

A signed informed consent form approved by the Duke University Institutional Review Board (IRB) will be required for patient enrollment into the study. Patients must be able to read and understand the informed consent document and must sign the informed consent indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study. 8. Brain MRI. Able to undergo brain MRI with and without contrast Exclusion Criteria: 1. Pregnancy. Because of the unknown risk of virus administration potentially affecting a developing fetus or growing infant, females who are pregnant or breast-feeding during the study period will be excluded. Adults of reproductive potential not employing an effective method of birth control will be excluded. Sexually active women of child bearing potential, whose partner is male, must use medically accepted birth control. Sexually active men, whose partner is a female of child bearing potential, must use a medically accepted birth control. 2. Disease Status. Because patients will receive drug intracerebrally, patients with an impending, life-threatening cerebral herniation syndrome, based on the assessment of the study neurosurgeons, Allan Friedman, John Sampson, or Peter Fecci, or their designate, will be excluded. 3. Medical Conditions. Because the potential toxicities from the agent being studied in this protocol may be similar to some known diseases or may be more dangerous in the context of certain known diseases, the following patients will be excluded to avoid confounding the study results: - Patients with an active infection requiring intravenous treatment or having an unexplained febrile illness (Tmax > 99.5 F/37.5 C). - Patients with known immunosuppressive disease or known human immunodeficiency virus infection. - Unstable or severe intercurrent medical conditions such as severe heart (New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4) or known lung (FEV1 < 50%) disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. - Albumin allergy.

Gadolinium is used as contrast for the MRI. 4. Previous Poliomyelitis. A history of neurological complications due to poliovirus infection would imply previous virus replication in the CNS. Based on animal studies, previous exposure to poliovirus administered intracerebrally can reduce subsequent virus replication in the CNS. 5. Prior Therapy. Patients who have not recovered from the toxic effects of prior chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy will be excluded. Guidelines for this recovery period are dependent upon the specific therapeutic agent being used: - Patients may not have received chemotherapy or bevacizumab ≤ 4 weeks [except for nitrosourea (6 weeks) or metronomic dosed chemotherapy such as daily etoposide or cyclophosphamide (1 week)] prior to starting the study drug unless patients have recovered from side effects of such therapy. - Patients may not have received immunotherapy ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting the study drug unless patients have recovered from side effects of such therapy. - Patients may not be less than 12 weeks from radiation therapy, unless progressive d disease outside of the radiation field or 2 progressive scans at least 4 weeks apart or histopathologic confirmation - Patients must have completed all standard of care treatments including surgical procedure and radiation therapy (at least 59Gy): - If the MGMT promoter in their tumor is known to be unmethylated, patients are not mandated to have received chemotherapy prior to participating in this trial. - If the MGMT promoter in their tumor is known to be methylated or the MGMT promoter status is unknown at the time of screening, patients must have received at least one chemotherapy regimen prior to participating in this trial. 6. Location and Extent of Tumor. Because of the potential toxicities from the agent, patients with neoplastic lesions in the brainstem, cerebellum or spinal cord, radiological evidence of multifocal disease, or leptomeningeal disease. Patients with evidence of diffuse subependymal disease or tumor in the brainstem, cerebellum, spinal cord, or CSF will be excluded. Since the study agent is a local treatment, patients with radiological evidence of active (growing) multifocal disease, tumors extending into or crossing the corpus callosum or leptomeningeal disease, will be excluded. 7. Subjects must not have diagnosis of agammaglobulinemia. Patients with the following will be excluded: - Undetectable anti-tetanus toxoid IgG (except for retreatment) - Known history of agammaglobulinemia 8. Patient on greater than 4mg per day of dexamethasone within the 2 weeks prior to admission for PVSRIPO infusion 9.

"TRIAL NAME: Phase I - NIH Study; BRIEF: Background: Proteus syndrome (PS) is caused by a mutation in the AKT1 gene. This gene makes a protein that communicates with other proteins in the body to make cells grow. The AKT1 mutation changes chemical signals in the body and causes overgrowth. PS can be fatal. The drug MK-7075 reduces signals from the AKT1 protein. This may reduce or stabilize some of the overgrowth in people with PS. Researchers want to find the best dose of MK-7075 based on its effect on tissues in people with PS. Objective: To determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended dose of MK-7075 in people with PS. Eligibility: People ages 6 and older with PS Design: Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine tests. Participants will take MK-7075 by mouth once daily for up to 12 28-day cycles. Participants must stay near the NIH Clinical Center (CC) during the whole first cycle, for weekly visits to the CC. For cycle 2, they will have visits every 2 weeks. They will have 1 visit before cycles 3 and 4, and once before every other cycle for cycles 5 11. The final visit will be at the end of cycle 12. Visits may include: Small skin samples taken. ECG: Soft electrodes on the skin record heart signals. Echocardiogram: A small probe held to the chest takes pictures of the heart. MRI: Participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body. Joint and mobility function tests. Participants will complete surveys by phone and in person. Participants will keep a daily medication and symptom diary. ... ; DRUG USED: Miransertib; DRUG CLASS: New Molecular Entity (NME); INDICATION: Proteus Syndrome; TARGET: PI3K/AKT pathway; THERAPY: Monotherapy; LEAD SPONSOR: National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI); CRITERIA: - INCLUSION CRITERIA: - Meets published clinical criteria for PS. - Measurable disease: Patients must have at least one measurable lesion for volumetric MRI or photographic CCTN. - Has a CLIA-validated report demonstrating presence of a mosaic AKT1 c.49G>A mutation. - 6 years of age or older.
