The main aim of this study is to learn if complex perianal fistulas in children and teenagers close after treatment with darvadstrocel. 2 to 3 weeks before treatment with darvadstrocel, each participant will have surgery to clean the fistula and to drain any abscesses. On the day of treatment, each participant will have the fistula cleaned and will receive an injection of darvadstrocel near the fistula, under anesthetic. For up to 1 year after treatment, participants will regularly visit the clinic for follow-up. The fistula will be examined and any side effects from the treatment will be recorded. Participants will have an MRI at one clinic visit (about 24 weeks after treatment).",Cx601,Biologic,Crohn's Disease,Stem Cells/Other Cell Therapies,Monotherapy,Takeda,"Inclusion Criteria: 1.

Phase II - w/Nivolumab vs. Chemotherapy (NCI),"This phase II trial compares cabozantinib alone and the combination of cabozantinib and nivolumab to standard chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Ramucirumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as docetaxel, gemcitabine hydrochloride, paclitaxel, and nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

Phase III - MERMAID-1,"This is a Phase III, randomized, parallel-arm, placebo controlled, double blind, multicenter study assessing the efficacy and safety of durvalumab versus placebo following SoC chemotherapy in patients with completely resected stage II-III NSCLC who are MRD+ post surgery",Imfinzi,Biologic,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),"Immune System, Programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1) / Programmed death ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2)",Combination,AstraZeneca,"Inclusion criteria: Patients must be capable of giving signed informed consent, which includes a mandatory genetic informed consent and compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent forms (ICFs) and in this protocol. Provision of signed and dated, written ICFs must occur prior to any mandatory study-specific procedures, sampling, and analyses. In addition to ICF1 and ICF2, patients will provide signed and dated written optional genetic informed consent prior to collection of a sample for optional genetic analysis at the time of second screening (Table 2). This is different from the genetic samples and testing covered by ICF1, which are mandatory for participation in this study. Criteria and procedures initiated with the signing of ICF1 1. ICF1 must be signed and dated prior to any study procedures and prior to the planned surgical resection of the primary NSCLC, with the exceptions noted below. This consent will cover the study-specific first screening procedures outlined in Table 1. Exception: Patients will be permitted to sign ICF1 up to Week 3 (Day 21) postsurgery. Patients identified after Week 3 post-surgery but prior to Week 5 (Day 35) post-surgery may be allowed to sign ICF1 depending on the outcome of the discussion with the study physician. In these cases, a whole blood sample and resected tumor tissue must be collected and sent to the diagnostic lab as soon as possible after ICF1 is signed for development of the personalized panel. A plasma sample must still be collected at Week 3-5 (Day 21-35) post-surgery, even if creation of the personalized panel for MRD detection is delayed. Age 2. Age ≥18 years at the time of screening. Sex 3. Male and/or female. Type of patient and disease characteristics 4. Individuals who have diagnosis of histologically confirmed NSCLC (WHO 2015 classification) with resectable (stage II-III) disease (according to IASLC Staging Manual in Thoracic Oncology v8.0). Select (ie, T3N2 or T4N2) stage IIIB patients will be eligible, provided that they are upstaged to T3N2 or T4N2 based on confirmed pathology. Patients who are staged asT3N2 or T4N2 prior to surgery are not eligible. 5. A contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scan of the chest must have been done for surgical planning prior to surgery. It is recommended that patients undergo combined FDG-PET (18F-Fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography) and CT scan (contrastenhanced or low-dose CT component) in order to rule out detectable extrathoracic, extracranial metastasis and to assess for potential mediastinal lymph node involvement prior to surgery. In the absence of pre-operative FDG-PET CT imaging, pre-operative contrast-enhanced CT imaging or MRI scan must cover liver and adrenal glands. If only CT is available, or FDG-PET reveals suspicious lymph node mediastinal involvement, it is recommended that invasive pre-operative mediastinal staging is performed according to the algorithm of the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons guidelines (algorithm to follow for primary mediastinal staging if only pre-operative CT is available [De Leyn et al 2007], algorithm to follow for primary mediastinal staging when PET-CT is available [De Leyn et al 2014]). It is preferred that imaging occurs within 6 weeks prior to surgery. Brain MRI (preferred) or brain CT with IV contrast is required for complete staging of the tumor. 6. Complete resection of the primary NSCLC is mandatory. The primary tumor must be deemed resectable by a multidisciplinary evaluation that must include a thoracic surgeon certified or trained according to local standards and who performs lung cancer surgery as a significant part of their practice. Surgical resection of the primary NSCLC can occur by open thoracotomy or by video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and resection can be achieved by segmentectomy, lobectomy, sleeve resection, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy. Patients undergoing wedge resection are not eligible for this study. Note: Patients undergoing segmentectomy must have tumors less than 2 cm in maximum diameter. Where a resection has been extended by means of a wedge resection of an adjacent lobe to ensure complete resection of a tumor at or crossing a fissure between lobes, this is acceptable if surgical margins are clear of disease. Where the resection of a second tumor nodule (eg, a T4 lesion) is undertaken by means of a wedge resection of a separate lobe, then the patient is not eligible. At a minimum, the following parameters should be met for a tumor to be declared completely resected: 1. The surgeon performing the resection should remove all gross disease by the end of surgery. All surgical margins of resection must be macroscopically negative for tumor. 2. Pathology and/or operative reports must include the examination of at least 2 different mediastinal lymph node (N2) levels, one of which is the subcarinal node-group (level 7) and the second of which is lobe-specific (defined below). Note: In the uncommon clinical situation where the surgeon thoroughly examines a mediastinal lymph node level and does not find any lymph nodes, that mediastinal lymph node level may be counted among the minimum 2 required levels. However, the surgeon must clearly document in the operative report or in a separate written statement that the lymph node level was explored and no lymph nodes were present. Normal appearing lymph nodes, if present, must be biopsied or removed. Exploration of nodes must clearly be documented in medical file if not recorded in operative report. Note: Lobe-specific lymph node stations are classified based on the location of the primary tumor as follows (based on IASLC 2009 lymph node map terminology [Rusch et al 2009]): Stations 2R and 4R for right upper lobe or middle lobe tumors, stations 4L, 5, and 6 for left upper lobe tumors, stations 8 and 9 for lower lobe tumors of both sides (Adachi et al 2017, Rami-Porta et al 2005). 3. No extracapsular nodal extension of the tumor is observed in resected mediastinal N2 lymph nodes. Note: Extracapsular nodal extension in resected N1 nodes is permitted. Note: The highest mediastinal node resected can be positive for malignancy. Note: Carcinoma-in-situ can be present at the bronchial margin. 7. All patients who enrol in the study prior to surgery must have a pre-surgical plasma sample collected for MRD evaluation. Patients will not be excluded from randomization based on the results of analysing the pre-surgical plasma samples. The following criteria must be met prior to signing ICF2: 8. Confirmation of suitable samples of resected tumor tissue and whole blood for WES of tumor and germline DNA, respectively, and creation of Sponsor-approved personalized panel for MRD detection. Tumor tissue and whole blood samples must be provided to the diagnostic laboratory for development of the personalized panel as soon as possible. Germline sequencing of whole blood is mandatory. Note: If a patient's tumor has less than the requisite 50 tumor-specific variants, a panel cannot be built and the patient will no longer be able to participate in the study. 9. Established MRD status (MRD+ or MRD-) based on Sponsor-approved personalized assay of a plasma sample collected at Week 3-5 (Day 21-35) post-surgery. 10. Known tumor PD-L1 status determined at a central reference laboratory testing service using a validated Ventana SP263 PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay prior randomization. Patients with unknown PD-L1 status are not eligible for the study. Criteria and procedures initiated with the signing of ICF2 11. Post-operative CT scan of the chest (including liver and adrenal glands) performed within 28 days + 7 days prior to randomization. If clinically indicated, additional scans (such as brain MRI [preferred] or brain CT with IV contrast) should be performed to confirm no evidence of metastasis. 12. ICF2 must be signed and dated after MRD status is determined and prior to initiation of any study-specific procedures, sampling, and analyses outlined in SoAs in Table 2 and Table 3. Randomization must occur within the 12 weeks (+ 7 days) following surgery. 13. WHO/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. 14.

Phase II - ATP,"Depression is one of the most important causes of disability in the world today, with major personal, social and economic costs. Although some moderately effective drug treatments are already available, about a third of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) remain depressed despite current treatment. There is growing evidence that inflammation - the response of the body's immune system to physical and social stresses - can cause depressive symptoms in some patients. It is therefore predicted that anti-inflammatory drugs could have anti-depressant effects and the research team aims to test this using a new drug, JNJ-54175446, which blocks the activity of a receptor called P2X7. P2X7 is present on many immune cells and plays a key role in the release of inflammatory molecules during stress, which may be linked to stress-related depression. The research team will recruit approximately up to 142 participants with MDD to this clinical trial. Patients will have moderate-severe depressive symptoms despite ongoing treatment with a conventional anti-depressant drug, and they will have blood test results at screening that indicate they are likely to have active P2X7 signalling in the brain. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to receive either 50mg/day JNJ-54175446 or placebo for 8 weeks. Participants will be assessed at weeks 2, 5 and 8 using a standard clinical depression scale and the scores compared between those treated with placebo and those treated with JNJ-54175446. To understand more about the effects of JNJ-54175446 on the immune system and the brain, patients will also complete additional blood tests, questionnaires and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans at different visits throughout the trial. The trial will be carried out across 5 centres in the UK.",JNJ-54175446,New Molecular Entity (NME),Major Depressive Disorder (MDD),P2X7 Receptor,Monotherapy,CCTU-Core,"The key eligibility criteria are listed below, to obtain the full list please contact the trial team.

Phase Ib/II - Atrophy Secondary to AMD,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease which causes people to lose their sharp central vision over time. Aging damages the macula, which is in the middle of the retina - the light-sensitive part at the back of the eye. There are 2 types of AMD - wet AMD and dry AMD. The advanced stage of dry AMD causes vision loss. This is known as geographic atrophy. AMD makes everyday tasks like reading or driving difficult. ASP7317 is a potential new treatment for people with AMD. ASP7317 are human stem cells which have changed into cells found in the retina. ASP7317 is injected under the macula. It is hoped that ASP7317 will replace some of the damaged cells in the macula and improve vision for people with dry AMD. Before ASP7317 is available as a treatment, the researchers need to check its safety and how well it is tolerated. They will also check for signs of improved vision. People taking part in this study will be older people who have geographic atrophy caused by dry AMD. This is an open-label study. This means that people in this study and clinic staff will know that people will receive ASP7317. There will be 3 doses of ASP7317. These are low, medium and high numbers of cells. ASP7317 will be injected under the macula after the person is given either a local or a general anesthetic. To prevent the body from rejecting the cells, people will take tablets of tacrolimus a few days before receiving ASP7317 for up to a few weeks afterwards. Other medicines will be taken during this time to stop infections. There will be 2 groups in the study. Group 1 will be people with severe vision loss and Group 2 will be people with moderate vision loss. There will be different small groups of people within Group 1 and Group 2, with each small group receiving 1 of the 3 doses of ASP7317. Different small groups of people within Group 1 and Group 2 will receive lower to higher doses of ASP7317. Each small group will only receive 1 dose. Group 1 will start treatment first. At each dose, a medical expert panel will check the results of the first person in the group to decide if the rest of the group will receive the same dose. Then, the panel will decide if more people may receive the same dose or if the next group may receive the next highest dose. The panel will use the results from the lower dose of Group 1 to decide when Group 2 starts treatment (also at the lower dose). The panel will also use the results of the middle and higher doses in Group 1 to decide when and how many people in Group 2 can receive these doses. During the study, people will visit the clinic several times for up to 12 months (1 year). During all visits, the study doctors will check for any medical problems after receiving ASP7317. Vital signs will be checked a few days before treatment with ASP7317 and up to about a month afterwards. Vital signs include blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. At some visits, the study doctors will also take blood samples for blood tests. At most visits, people will have eye tests and have different images, scans, and measurements taken. This could be for the affected eye or both eyes, depending on the test. People can visit the clinic extra times, if needed.",ASP7317,Biologic,Dry Age-Related Macular Degeneration (Dry AMD)/Geographic Atrophy (Ophthalmology),Stem Cells/Other Cell Therapies,Monotherapy,Astellas Institute for Regenerative Medicine,"General Inclusion Criteria - Participant must be willing to take tacrolimus and willing to discontinue any medications that have a known strong interaction with tacrolimus. - Participant is able and willing to undertake all scheduled visits and assessments up to the week 52 visit. - Participant who is taking an antidepressant must be on a stable and effective dosage and must be willing to take it reliably for as long as it is required. - Participant must be willing and medically suitable to undergo monitored anesthesia care during the vitrectomy and subretinal injection. - Participant agrees to conform to local and institutional policies regarding active COVID-19 infections. - Participant agrees not to participate in another interventional study until the 52-week visit has been completed. - Female participant is not pregnant and at least 1 of the following conditions apply: - Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) - WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance from the time of informed consent through at least 52 weeks after investigational product (IP) administration. - Female participant must agree not to breastfeed starting at screening and throughout the study period and for 52 weeks after IP administration. - Female participant must not donate ova starting at first dose of IP and throughout the study period and for 52 weeks after IP administration. - Male participant with female partner(s) of childbearing potential (including breastfeeding partner) must agree to use contraception throughout the treatment period and for 52 weeks after IP administration. - Male participant must not donate sperm during the treatment period and for 52 weeks after IP administration. - Male participant with pregnant partner(s) must agree to remain abstinent or use a condom for the duration of the pregnancy throughout the study period and for 52 weeks after IP administration.

Phase II - Singapore General Hospital,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a pandemic. COVID-19 poses a mortality risk of 3-7%, rising to 20% in older patients with co-morbidities. Of all infected patients, 15-20% will develop severe respiratory symptoms necessitating hospital admission. Around 5% of patients will require invasive mechanical ventilation, and up to 50% will die. Evidence in severe COVID-19 suggests that these patients experience cytokine storm and progressed rapidly with acute respiratory distress syndrome and eventual multi-organ failure. Early identification and immediate treatment of hyperinflammation is thus recommended to reduce mortality. Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) has been shown to be a myelopoietic growth factor that has pleiotropic effects in promoting the differentiation of immature precursors into polymorphonuclear neutrophils, monocytes/ macrophages and dendritic cells, and also in controlling the function of fully mature myeloid cells. It plays an important role in priming monocytes for production of proinflammatory cytokines under TLR and NLR stimulation. It has a broad impact on the processes driving DC differentiation and affects DC effector function at the mature state. Importantly, GM-CSF plays a critical role in host defense and stimulating antiviral immunity. Detailed studies have also shown that GM-CSF is necessary for the maturation of alveolar macrophages from foetal monocytes and the maintenance of these cells in adulthood. The known toxicology, pharmacologic and safety data also support the use of Leukine® in hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS due to COVID-19. This study aims to recruit patients with evidence of pneumonia and hypoxia who have increased risk for severe disease and need for mechanical ventilation. The overall hypothesis is that GM-CSF has antiviral immunity, can provide the stimulus to restore immune homeostasis in the lung with acute lung injury from COVID-19, and can promote lung repair mechanisms, which would lead to improvement in lung oxygenation parameters.",Leukine,Biologic,COVID-19 Treatment,Granulocyte Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor Receptor (GM-CSFR)/CD116,Monotherapy,Singapore General Hospital,"Inclusion Criteria: - SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection - Presence of acute hypoxic respiratory failure defined as (either or both) - Saturation < 94% on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen - PaO2/FiO2 below 350 - Age 21-80 - Able and willing to provide informed consent Exclusion Criteria: - Patients who are already on supplemental oxygen of FiO2 ≥ 0.4 - Patients with known history of serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, to human GM-CSF such as Leukine®, yeast-derived products, or any component of the product. - Mechanical ventilation before start of study - Patients enrolled in another investigational drug study - Pregnant or breastfeeding females (all female subjects of childbearing potential status must have negative pregnancy test at screening) - Patients with peripheral white blood cell count above 25,000 per microliter and/or active myeloid malignancy - Patients on high dose systemic steroids (> 20mg methylprednisolone or equivalent) - Patients on lithium carbonate therapy - Patients with serum ferritin >2000 mcg/ml (which will exclude ongoing HLH)",Measuring oxygenation,,Yes,No

Phase I - Glioblastoma (w/CMC),"The primary goal of this Phase 1 study is to determine if a new investigational drug, OS2966, when delivered directly to the brain of adult participants with recurrent/progressive high-grade glioma (HGG) is safe and well tolerated. OS2966 is a therapeutic antibody blocking a cell surface receptor governing fundamental biological processes that allow cancer cells to grow, spread and become resistant to cancer treatment. Despite availability of new promising cancer treatments, successful treatment of HGG has been limited by the presence of the brain's protective blood brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is made up of tightly knit cells that block entry of several substances including cancer treatments. To overcome this obstacle, a technique called convection-enhanced-delivery (CED) will be utilized to deliver OS2966 directly to the site of disease. Convection-enhanced delivery involves placement of one or more catheters into the brain tumor and tumor-infiltrated brain in order to slowly pump a therapy into the tissue.

Phase Ib - NCI,"Background: - Pazopanib is an anticancer drug that blocks the growth of new blood vessels in tumors. It has been approved to treat renal cell cancer and soft tissue sarcomas in patients who have received prior chemotherapy. ARQ 197 (Tivantinib) is an experimental drug that blocks a protein called mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET), which cancer cells need to grow. Studies suggest that some drugs that block blood vessel growth can increase the production of c-MET in tumors, which helps cancer cells keep growing. Blocking both blood vessel growth and c-MET with pazopanib and ARQ 197 may help kill cancer cells faster. This study will use these drugs to treat solid tumors that have not responded to earlier treatments. Objectives: - To test the safety and effectiveness of pazopanib and ARQ 197 for advanced solid tumors. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced solid tumors that have not responded to earlier treatments. Design: - Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also have blood and urine tests, and imaging studies. - The study drugs will be given in 4-week cycles of treatment. Participants will take pazopanib once a day and ARQ 197 twice a day by mouth. Some participants will start with pazopanib or ARQ 197 alone for the first week.

Phase II - NCI,"Background: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men. When prostate cancer is confined to the prostate there is a high chance of cure. However, it is outside the prostate or comes back after treatment, additional therapy may be needed. Current methods of imaging prostate cancer are limited. Researchers want to see if a radiotracer called 18F-DCFPyL can identify prostate cancer in patients who have a high risk of cancer spreading outside the prostate or who have signs of recurrent cancer after treatment. Objectives: To see if the radiotracer 18F-DCFyL can help identify prostate cancer in the body before or after therapy. Eligibility: Men ages 18 and older who have prostate cancer that has been newly diagnosed, or has relapsed after radiation or surgery Design: Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will have blood taken. Participants will be divided into 2 groups. - Group 1 will be men with cancer that has been newly diagnosed as high risk by their doctor who are scheduled to have prostate removal surgery or undergo biopsy before radiation therapy. - Group 2 will be men who have presumed prostate cancer relapse after prostate removal surgery or radiation therapy. Both groups will have scans taken. Participants will lie still on a table in a machine that takes pictures of their body. 18F-DCFyL will be injected by intravenous (IV) line. Participants will be contacted for follow-up after scans. Participants in Group 1 may have surgery to remove their prostate gland or a biopsy to remove some prostate tissue. This procedure will be standard of care and is not a part of this study. They will also have an extra MRI scan of their prostate.

Phase I - MAD,"RBN-2397 inhibits PARP7, an enzyme that is switched on by cancer stresses, such as the toxins in cigarette smoke. Cancer cells use PARP7 to hide from the immune system by stopping the cell from sending a signal (Type 1 interferon) that tells the immune system that something is wrong and to kill the cell. RBN-2397 has been shown in animal studies to inhibit tumor growth and also shuts down the ""don't kill me"" signal the tumor is sending to evade the immune system. As a PARP7 inhibitor RBN-2397 is different from drugs inhibiting PARP1, PARP2 and PARP3 enzymes which are approved for the treatment of certain ovarian and breast cancers. The primary purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of orally administered RBN-2397 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

Phase II - Pediatric Low Grade Gliomas,"This study is for patients up to 21 years of age who have a tumor called a low grade glioma of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). The tumor has grown despite attempts to control it with chemotherapy or radiation. Low grade gliomas are a group of tumors that tend to grow slowly and could be cured if every bit of the tumor were surgically removed. These tumors are called Grade I or II astrocytomas. These tumors often grow in parts of the brain that prevent total removal without devastating neurologic complications or death. Although some low grade gliomas never grow, most will and are treated with either chemotherapy or radiation. There is good data showing that the growth of most low grade gliomas can be controlled with chemotherapy or radiation. However, some low grade gliomas in children and young adults grow despite these treatments. Poly-ICLC is a new drug that has been used safely in children and adults with different types of brain tumors. Earlier studies showed that this drug worked better for children and young adults with low grade gliomas than for children with more aggressive brain tumors. The main purpose of this study is to use Poly-ICLC treatment in a larger number of patients to see how well it works and how many side effects occur. As Poly-ICLC is not FDA approved, this study is authorized to use it under Investigational New Drug (IND)# 43984, held by Oncovir. Subjects will get injections of Poly-ICLC into muscle two times weekly. The first treatments will be given in the clinic so allergic or other severe reactions, if any, can be monitored. If subjects tolerate the injections and don't have a severe reaction, then the rest of the injections will be given at home. Subjects/caregivers will be trained to give injections. Treatment will last for about 2 years. Subjects may stay on treatment for longer than 2 years if their tumor shrinks in response to the injections, if study doctors think it is safe, if subjects want to remain on treatment, and if Poly-ICLC is available. Risks: Poly-ICLC has been used safely in children and adults at the dose used in this study, and at higher doses. Frequently seen side effects include irritation of the skin at the injection site and mild flu-like symptoms. These are usually relieved or avoided by use of over-the-counter medicines like acetaminophen (Tylenol).",Poly-ICLC,Non-NME,Brain Cancer (Malignant Glioma,"Interferon Receptor, Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)",Monotherapy,Wake Forest University Health Sciences,"Inclusion Criteria: - Age:Patients must be between 0 - 21 years of age when registered on this protocol. - Diagnosis:Patients must have pathologically confirmed low grade glioma with histologic subtypes interpreted as World Health Organization (WHO) grade I and II including: - juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma (JPA) - pleomorphic JPA - diffuse astrocytoma (fibrillary, gemistocytic, giant cell, or pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma) - low grade oligoastrocytoma - low grade oligodendroglioma - low grade glioma not otherwise specified (NOS) Tumors of all regions of the CNS, with appropriate histology are eligible for study.

While agitation may have various underlying causes, patients with schizophrenia are especially vulnerable to acute episodes of agitation, especially during exacerbation of disease, and clinicians do not always diagnose these episodes early enough. Agitation associated with psychosis is a frequent reason for emergency department visits, and unless it is recognized early and managed effectively, it can rapidly escalate to potentially dangerous behaviors, including physical violence. Educating psychiatric professionals about the timely and accurate diagnosis of agitation among patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and developing a well-tolerated easily administered medication will contribute to the prompt and effective management of this condition and could help reduce the risk of violent behavior and other undesirable outcomes. This study is designed to identify the ideal dose range and tolerability of sublingual Dexmedetomidine in patients with schizophrenia.",BXCL501,Non-NME,Schizophrenia,Alpha 2 Adrenergic Receptor,Monotherapy,Yale University,"Inclusion Criteria: 1.

Phase I/II - NCI,"Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause cervical, throat, anal, and genital cancers. Cancers caused by HPV have a HPV protein called E7 inside of their cells. In this new therapy, researchers take a person s blood, remove certain white blood cells, and insert genes that make them to target cancer cells that have the E7 protein. The genetically changed cells, called E7 TCR cells, are then given back to the person to fight the cancer. Researchers want to see if this can help people. Objective: To determine a safe dose and efficacy of E7 TCR cells and whether these cells can help patients. Eligibility: Adults ages 18 and older with an HPV-16-associated cancer, including cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, or oropharyngeal. Design: Participants will list all their medicines. Participants will have many screening tests, including imaging procedures, heart and lung tests, and lab tests. They will have a large catheter inserted into a vein. Participants will have leukapheresis. Blood will be removed through a needle in the arm. A machine separates the white blood cells. The rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other arm. The cells will be changed in the lab. Participants will stay in the hospital. Over several days, they will get: Chemotherapy drugs E7 TCR cells Shots or injections to stimulate the cells Participants will be monitored in the hospital up to 12 days. They will get support medicine and have blood and lab tests. Participants will have a clinic visit about 40 days after cell infusion. They will have a physical exam, blood work, scans, and maybe x-rays. Participants will have many follow-up visits with the same procedures. At some visits, they may undergo leukapheresis.

"Phase II - w/Fulvestrant, HR+ (Dana Farber)","Ganetespib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing. This drug has been used in other research studies and laboratory experiments. It has also been studied in phase I trials, where the appropriate dosing has been determined. Ganetespib is considered an ""HSP90 inhibitor"". By blocking HSP90, ganetespib is thought to reduce the ability of cancer cells to become resistant to treatment. Fulvestrant is a hormonal therapy that works by attaching to estrogen receptors. In doing so, it can block the effect of estrogen on cancer cells. In addition, fulvestrant causes a decrease in the number of estrogen receptors.

Phase I/II - CD30+ HL/NHL (UNC),"The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from disease caused by bacteria or toxic substances. Antibodies work by binding those bacteria or substances, which stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that are infected. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most patients. This study is designed to combine both T cells and antibodies to create a more effective treatment called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted against the CD30 antigen (ATLCAR.CD30) administration. In previous studies, it has been shown that a new gene can be put into T cells that will increase their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. The new gene that is put in the T cells in this study makes an antibody called anti-CD30. This antibody sticks to lymphoma cells because of a substance on the outside of the cells called CD30. Anti-CD30 antibodies have been used to treat people with lymphoma, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients. For this study, the anti-CD30 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These CD30 chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells seem to kill some of the tumor, but they do not last very long in the body and so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown. The purpose of this research study is to establish a safe dose of ATLCAR.CD30 cells to infuse after lymphodepleting chemotherapy and to estimate the number patients whose cancer does not progress for two years after ATLCAR.CD30 administration. This study will also look at other effects of ATLCAR.CD30 cells, including their effect on the patient's cancer.",TT11 CD30 CAR-T,Biologic,Hodgkin's Lymphoma,"Autologous Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells (CAR-T), Cluster of Differentiation 30 (CD30) / TNFRSF8, Immune System",Monotherapy,UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center,"Inclusion Criteria Prior to Cell Procurement Informed consent explained to, understood by and signed by the subject or legal guardian for pediatric subjects",Number of participants with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability of ATLCAR.CD30 cells to establish a safe dose after lymphodepletion with bendamustine in adult patients,2 year overall survival (OS) after administration of CAR.CD30 transduced ATL following lymphodepletion with bendamustine and fludarabine in adult and pediatric patients with CD30+ relapsed/refractory HL and NHL.,No,No

Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving lenalidomide together with rituximab and combination chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.

Phase Ib/II - 160060,"Background: Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is a complication people can experience after hematopoietic stem cell transplant. It usually affects people with chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD). This occurs when donor stem cells attack the cells of the person who received them. BOS reduces airflow and oxygen levels in the body. It may be caused by neutrophil elastase in the body. Researchers believe the new drug alvelestat (MPH966) may help. Objectives: To test the safety of alvelestat (MPH966) and see what dose best inhibits neutrophil elastase in people with BOS after a stem cell transplant. To study how well the best dose improves lung function in those people. Eligibility: Adults 18 and older who have had a hematopoietic stem cell transplant and have cGVHD and BOS. Design: Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine tests. They will have lung function and heart function tests. They will have computed tomography scans of the chest. Study part 1: Participants will take the starting dose of the study drug by mouth twice a day for 14 days. This is 1 cycle. They will get different doses, for up to 4 cycles. Study part 2: Participants will take the study drug twice a day by mouth at the dose set in part 1, for up to 12 months. Participants will keep medicine diaries. Participants will have several study visits. These may include: Repeats of the screening tests. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage.

Phase II - SG016,"SNG001 is an inhaled drug that contains a antiviral protein called interferon beta (IFN-β). IFN-β in produced in the lungs during viral lung infections. It has been shown that older people and people with some chronic diseases have an IFN-β deficiency. Many viruses inhibit IFN-β as part of their strategy to evade the immune system. Addition of IFN-β in vitro protects lung cells from viral infection. IFN-β protects cells against the MERS and SARS coronaviruses (close relatives of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19). SNG001 is an inhaled formulation of interferon beta-1a it is currently in Phase II clinical trials for COPD patients. Synairgen has conducted randomised placebo controlled clinical trials of SNG001 involving >200 asthma and COPD patients. These trials have shown that SNG001 has: - been well tolerated during virus infections - enhanced antiviral activity in the lungs (measured in sputum and blood samples) - provided significant lung function benefit over placebo in asthma in two Phase II trials. Synairgen believes SNG001 could help prevent worsening or accelerate recovery of severe lower respiratory tract illness in COVID-19 patients. Patients who are in hospital or non-hospitalised but are a high risk groups (e.g. elderly or diabetics) will be invited to take part in the trial. The patient would receive either SNG001 or placebo once daily for 14 days. The severity of the patients condition would be recorded on a scale developed by the World Health Organisation and the patient would be asked questions about their breathlessness, cough and sputum every day, as well as assess their general medical condition and safety. The study will start as a Pilot phase where 100 patients will be randomised in the hospital setting and a 120 patients randomised in the home setting. Once each of the Pilot phases are complete, a Pivotal phase will be conducted. It is estimated that the size of each of the Pivotal phases (hospital and home) will be around 100 to 300 patients per arm. The actual number will be determined after the data review at the end of each of the Pilot phases.

Phase III - Pediatric (Ages 10-18),"The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drugs dapagliflozin and saxagliptin in patients with Type 2 Diabetes who are aged 10 to below 18 years old and are currently taking metformin, insulin, or both drugs. Dapagliflozin and saxagliptin are both approved for use in patients with Type 2 Diabetes aged 18 years or older. Dapagliflozin (alone or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs) is available for use in adults in approximately 115 countries worldwide including the USA and Europe. Saxagliptin (alone or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs) is available for use in adults in approximately 100 countries worldwide. This study will assess how well dapagliflozin and saxagliptin work by finding out how these treatments affect blood glucose (sugar) levels compared to placebo (a pill that contains no active drug), in children and adolescents. Dapagliflozin and saxagliptin are considered investigational products in this study since while they have been approved for use in adults (patients 18 years or older), they haven't been approved for children and adolescents due to lack of clinical studies in this specific population. Patients with Type 2 Diabetes have higher levels of blood glucose (sugar) than patients who do not have this disease.The high level of sugar in the blood can lead to serious short-term and long-term medical problems. The main goal of treating diabetic patients is to lower blood glucose to a normal level. Lowering and controlling blood glucose help prevent or delay complications of diabetes, such as heart disease, kidney, eye and nerve diseases, and the possibility of amputation. Dapagliflozin is a drug that helps to reduce blood glucose levels by helping the kidneys to remove excess glucose from the blood and excrete it in the urine. It prevents the kidneys from returning glucose from the urine back into the bloodstream. Saxagliptin increases insulin production when blood glucose levels are high. Saxagliptin helps to improve blood sugar levels in response to a meal and between meals if blood glucose levels are not lowered effectively. Saxagliptin does not work when the blood glucose is low. Saxagliptin also helps to decrease the amount of sugar made by the body. Together, these processes reduce blood glucose levels and help to control Type 2 Diabetes. The subject will either receive one of the active study drugs or a placebo (a pill that looks identical but contains inactive drug).

To determine the response rate to lenalidomide and dexamethasone plus rituximab therapy in subjects with recurrent small B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who have had lymphoma progression within 6 months of being treated with rituximab alone or with a rituximab-containing regimen, we propose initial treatment with both drugs for two 28-day treatment cycles (Part I). After response assessment following two cycles of lenalidomide-dexamethasone, patients will enter Part II of the study. In Part II, patients will receive lenalidomide-dexamethasone and rituximab to evaluate the potential reversal of rituximab resistance as measured by response to rituximab and progression-free survival following rituximab.",Revlimid,New Molecular Entity (NME),Indolent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (Including Follicular Lymphoma) - NHL,"Angiogenesis, E3 ubiquitin ligase, Immune System",Combination,Abramson Cancer Center at Penn Medicine,"Inclusion Criteria: - Previously treated, histologically confirmed follicular lymphoma (grade 1, 2, 3a), marginal zone lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma with less than <5000 lymphocytes/mm3 or lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with <3g/mL IgM, mantle cell lymphoma by WHO classification - Flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry must document CD20 antigen expression.

Phase II - w/Cytarabine and Mitoxantrone,"This pilot phase II trial studies how well CPI-613 (6,8-bis[benzylthio]octanoic acid), cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride work in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or granulocytic sarcoma (a malignant, green-colored tumor of myeloid cells [a type of immature white blood cell]) that has returned (relapsed) or that does not respond to treatment (refractory). 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid is thought to kill cancer cells by turning off their mitochondria. Mitochondria are used by cancer cells to produce energy and are the building blocks needed to make more cancer cells. By shutting off these mitochondria, 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid deprives the cancer cells of energy and other supplies that they need to survive and grow in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine and mitoxantrone hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

Phase I - NIH Study,"Background: Proteus syndrome (PS) is caused by a mutation in the AKT1 gene. This gene makes a protein that communicates with other proteins in the body to make cells grow. The AKT1 mutation changes chemical signals in the body and causes overgrowth. PS can be fatal. The drug MK-7075 reduces signals from the AKT1 protein. This may reduce or stabilize some of the overgrowth in people with PS. Researchers want to find the best dose of MK-7075 based on its effect on tissues in people with PS. Objective: To determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended dose of MK-7075 in people with PS. Eligibility: People ages 6 and older with PS Design: Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine tests. Participants will take MK-7075 by mouth once daily for up to 12 28-day cycles. Participants must stay near the NIH Clinical Center (CC) during the whole first cycle, for weekly visits to the CC. For cycle 2, they will have visits every 2 weeks. They will have 1 visit before cycles 3 and 4, and once before every other cycle for cycles 5 11. The final visit will be at the end of cycle 12. Visits may include: Small skin samples taken. ECG: Soft electrodes on the skin record heart signals. Echocardiogram: A small probe held to the chest takes pictures of the heart. MRI: Participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body. Joint and mobility function tests. Participants will complete surveys by phone and in person.

Phase IIb - GOLDEN-505,"Abdominal obesity and type-2 Diabetes are associated with chronic liver disorders resulting from the accumulation of fat in the liver (steatosis), which may progress towards hepatitis and possibly lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. NAFLD (Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease) is considered as the most common form of chronic liver disease in adults in the United States, Australia, Asia and Europe. In the USA, the estimated prevalence of NAFLD is 20-30% of the adult population. Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressing form of NAFLD, which corresponds to hepatic steatosis associated with inflammation and liver cell injury upon microscopic examination of a liver biopsy. This condition may lead to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis and deserves serious medical management. Up to now, there is no effective drug which has clearly demonstrated therapeutic efficacy which may help lifestyle and dietary recommendations in the resolution of NASH. In this context, GENFIT is developing a new liver targeted drug candidate, GFT505, for the treatment of NASH and the reduction of multiple cardiometabolic risk factors associated with the metabolic syndrome and type 2 Diabetes. This phase IIb study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of GFT505 80mg and 120mg once daily for 52 weeks on the reversal of NASH without worsening of fibrosis, based on liver biopsy assessments.",Elafibranor,New Molecular Entity (NME),Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH),"PPAR alpha, PPAR delta",Monotherapy,Genfit,"Inclusion Criteria: - Males or females (females must be either of non-child bearing potential or using an efficient double contraception).

A signed informed consent form approved by the Duke University Institutional Review Board (IRB) will be required for patient enrollment into the study. Patients must be able to read and understand the informed consent document and must sign the informed consent indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study. 8. Brain MRI. Able to undergo brain MRI with and without contrast Exclusion Criteria: 1. Pregnancy. Because of the unknown risk of virus administration potentially affecting a developing fetus or growing infant, females who are pregnant or breast-feeding during the study period will be excluded. Adults of reproductive potential not employing an effective method of birth control will be excluded. Sexually active women of child bearing potential, whose partner is male, must use medically accepted birth control. Sexually active men, whose partner is a female of child bearing potential, must use a medically accepted birth control. 2. Disease Status. Because patients will receive drug intracerebrally, patients with an impending, life-threatening cerebral herniation syndrome, based on the assessment of the study neurosurgeons, Allan Friedman, John Sampson, or Peter Fecci, or their designate, will be excluded. 3. Medical Conditions. Because the potential toxicities from the agent being studied in this protocol may be similar to some known diseases or may be more dangerous in the context of certain known diseases, the following patients will be excluded to avoid confounding the study results: - Patients with an active infection requiring intravenous treatment or having an unexplained febrile illness (Tmax > 99.5 F/37.5 C). - Patients with known immunosuppressive disease or known human immunodeficiency virus infection. - Unstable or severe intercurrent medical conditions such as severe heart (New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4) or known lung (FEV1 < 50%) disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. - Albumin allergy.

Gadolinium is used as contrast for the MRI. 4. Previous Poliomyelitis. A history of neurological complications due to poliovirus infection would imply previous virus replication in the CNS. Based on animal studies, previous exposure to poliovirus administered intracerebrally can reduce subsequent virus replication in the CNS. 5. Prior Therapy. Patients who have not recovered from the toxic effects of prior chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy will be excluded. Guidelines for this recovery period are dependent upon the specific therapeutic agent being used: - Patients may not have received chemotherapy or bevacizumab ≤ 4 weeks [except for nitrosourea (6 weeks) or metronomic dosed chemotherapy such as daily etoposide or cyclophosphamide (1 week)] prior to starting the study drug unless patients have recovered from side effects of such therapy. - Patients may not have received immunotherapy ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting the study drug unless patients have recovered from side effects of such therapy. - Patients may not be less than 12 weeks from radiation therapy, unless progressive d disease outside of the radiation field or 2 progressive scans at least 4 weeks apart or histopathologic confirmation - Patients must have completed all standard of care treatments including surgical procedure and radiation therapy (at least 59Gy): - If the MGMT promoter in their tumor is known to be unmethylated, patients are not mandated to have received chemotherapy prior to participating in this trial. - If the MGMT promoter in their tumor is known to be methylated or the MGMT promoter status is unknown at the time of screening, patients must have received at least one chemotherapy regimen prior to participating in this trial. 6. Location and Extent of Tumor. Because of the potential toxicities from the agent, patients with neoplastic lesions in the brainstem, cerebellum or spinal cord, radiological evidence of multifocal disease, or leptomeningeal disease. Patients with evidence of diffuse subependymal disease or tumor in the brainstem, cerebellum, spinal cord, or CSF will be excluded. Since the study agent is a local treatment, patients with radiological evidence of active (growing) multifocal disease, tumors extending into or crossing the corpus callosum or leptomeningeal disease, will be excluded. 7. Subjects must not have diagnosis of agammaglobulinemia. Patients with the following will be excluded: - Undetectable anti-tetanus toxoid IgG (except for retreatment) - Known history of agammaglobulinemia 8.

Phase II - IMMUNOCERV,"This phase IIA trial studies the effect of a vaccine (PDS0101) when given together with chemotherapy and radiation therapy (chemoradiation) in treating patients with stage IB3-IVA cervical cancer. Chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. PDS0101 is a type of vaccine that is intended to help the immune system respond to human papillomavirus (HPV16)-infected cervical tumor cells. PDS0101 contains two active components: the first is called R-DOTAP (Versamune) and is included in the vaccine to boost the immune system's response against the HPV viral proteins and the second group of active components are selected small pieces of proteins (called peptides) taken from the HPV virus.

Filgrastim may increase the production of blood cells and may help the immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. Giving liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine followed by fludarabine phosphate, cytarabine, and filgrastim may be a better treatment for patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia and may cause fewer side effects to the heart, a common effect of other chemotherapy treatments for acute myeloid leukemia.",Vyxeos,Non-NME,Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML),"DNA polymerase, DNA synthesis, Topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase)",Monotherapy,Children's Oncology Group,"Inclusion Criteria: - Patients must have had histologic verification of AML at original diagnosis - Patient must have one of the following: - Recurrent disease with >= 5% blasts in the bone marrow (M2/M3 bone marrow), with or without extramedullary disease. - Recurrent disease with an absolute blast count greater than 1,000 per microliter in the peripheral blood with or without extramedullary disease - To be eligible for the dose-finding phase: (the dose-finding phase completed in 12/2016) - Relapsed patients - Patients must be in first relapse, and - Patients must not have received prior re-induction therapy - Refractory patients - Patients must not have received more than one attempt at remission induction, which may consist of up to two different therapy courses",Number of Participants With a Dose-limiting Toxicity,Percentage of Responders (Complete Response or Complete Remission With Partial or Incomplete Platelet Recovery) After First Cycle of Therapy,Yes,Yes

Phase I - HESTIA,"Subjects have a type of cancer that has been associated with an infection with a virus called human papilloma virus (HPV). The cancer has come back, has not gone away after standard treatment or the subject cannot receive standard treatment. This is a research study using special immune system cells called HPVST cells, a new experimental treatment. Investigators want to find out if they can use this type of treatment in patients with HPV-cancers. They have discovered a way to grow large number of HPV-specific T cells from the blood of patients with HPV-cancers. They want to see if these special white blood cells, called HPVST cells, that will have been trained to kill HPV infected cells can survive in the blood and affect the tumor. They will also see if they can make the T cells more active against the HPV-cancers by engineering them to be resistant to the TGF-beta chemical that these HPV-cancers produce. They will grow these HPVST cells from the patient's blood. The purpose of this study is to find the biggest dose of HPVSTs that is safe, to see how long they last in the body, to learn what the side effects are and to see if the HPVSTs will help people with HPV associated cancers. If the treatment with HPVST cells alone proves safe (Group A), additional group of patients (Group B) will receive Nivolumab in addition to HPVST cells in a lymphodepleted environment. Nivolumab is an antibody therapy that helps T cells control the tumor and it is FDA approved for the treatment of certain types of cancers, including Hodgkin's lymphoma. Lymphodepletion will decrease the level of circulating T cells prior to infusion of HPVST cells, thereby giving them room to expand. The purpose of this part of the study is to find out if TGF-beta resistant HPVST cells in combination with Nivolumab are safe, how long they last in the body and if they are more effective than HPVST cells alone in controlling the tumor.",TT12 HP-VST,Biologic,Cervical Cancer,"Human Papillomavirus (HPV), Immune System",Monotherapy and Combo Therapy,Baylor College of Medicine,"Inclusion Criteria: PROCUREMENT 1.

Phase I - STELLA,"This study uses special blood cells called multiple tumor-associated antigen (TAA)-specific T cells to treat patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) which has come back, or may come back, or has not gone away after standard treatment, including an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The investigators have previously used this sort of therapy to treat Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphomas that are infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is found in cancer cells of up to half of all patients with Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This suggests that it may play a role in causing lymphoma. The cancer cells infected by EBV are able to hide from the body's immune system and escape being killed. The investigators previously tested whether special white blood cells (called T cells) that were trained to kill EBV-infected cells could affect these tumors, and in many patients the investigators found that giving these trained T cells caused a complete or partial response. Other cancers express specific proteins that can be targeted in the same way. The investigators have been able to infuse such tumor-targeted cells into up to 10 patients with lymphoma who do not have EBV, and seen some complete responses. Importantly, the treatment appears to be safe. Therefore, the investigators now want to test whether the investigators can direct these special T cells against other types of cancers that carry similar proteins called tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). These proteins are specific to the leukemia cell, so they either do not show up, or show up in low quantities, on normal human cells.

Phase II - w/Nivolumab - Angiosarcoma (NCI),"This phase II trial studies how well paclitaxel with and without nivolumab works in treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma that have not received taxane drugs, and how well nivolumab and cabozantinib work in treating taxane pretreated patients with soft tissue sarcoma. Nivolumab works through the body's immune system to help the immune system act against tumor cells. Chemotherapy drugs, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

Women with previously untreated metastatic breast cancer (breast cancer that has spread to other organs) and with high levels of the HER2/neu receptor receive as their usual treatment chemotherapy with one of the approved chemotherapy drugs paclitaxel or docetaxel (called ""taxanes"") together with another approved drug called ""trastuzumab"". Chemotherapy drugs, such as paclitaxel and docetaxel, work either by killing tumour cells or by stopping them from dividing. Trastuzumab is an antibody that is given through a vein in the arm and it works by specifically ""targeting"" the HER2/neu i.e. it attaches to it and ""turns it off"". Although some of the patients who receive this taxane plus trastuzumab treatment feel better for some months, the cancer usually starts to grow again. Lapatinib is a new drug. Like trastuzumab, it also works by specifically ""targeting"" the HER2/neu receptor, but it does so in a different way. Lapatinib is not an antibody. It is a pill that is taken daily by mouth. Because lapatinib works in a different way than trastuzumab, it may be worse, as good as or better than trastuzumab in keeping metastatic HER/neu positive cancer from growing. However, this is not known. Purpose: This randomized Phase III trial is comparing chemotherapy (a taxane) given together with lapatinib with chemotherapy (a taxane) given together with trastuzumab in women with HER2/neu positive breast cancer.",Tykerb,New Molecular Entity (NME),Breast Cancer,"EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), HER2/neu or ErbB-2","CRITERIA: DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: -
